  "Content": "Lesson 4: Using Passport Authentication\n\nThis lesson recognizes that Microsoft attempted to solve the \"Single Sign-On\" problem for the Windows platform. SSO is an industry-wide acronym maintained by OpenGroup.org (among others) at http://www.opengroup.org/security/sso/.\n\nAs of this writing there is doubt that this technology is an active concern at Microsoft. The Passport SDK is currently not available for download from here:\n\n    http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/downloads/list/websrvpass.asp\n\n* \"Passport authentication identifies users via Microsoft Passport's single sign-on service. Microsoft Passport is meant to provide Internet users with a single identity that they can use to visit a wide variety of Web sites that require authentication.\"\n\nTo declare Passport authentication in Web.config, this is a pattern:\n\n    <authentication mode=\"Passport\" />\n    <authorization>\n        <deny users=\"?\" />\n        <!-- Deny unauthenticated users -->\n    </authorization>\n\nThe code used to implement authentication is almost identical to the code used for NTLM authentication discussed in \"Lesson 2: Using Windows Authentication,\" featuring use of System.Web.UI.Page.User.Identity.",
