  "Content": "OPERATORS: =\nThe basic assignment operator is the equal sign, which assigns the value (literal or variable) on its right to the variable on its left:\n\nCode:\nx = a;\n\nThe assignment operator can also be combined with a variety of other operators to provide shorthand versions of standard operations. It combines with the arithmetic operators +, -, *, / and % to give the following shorthand versions:\n\na += b instead of a = a + b\na -= b instead of a = a - b\na *= b instead of a = a * b\na /= b instead of a = a / b\na %= b instead of a = a % b\n\nIt also combines with the following bitwise operators:\n\na <<= b instead of a = a << b\na >>= b instead of a = a >> b\na >>>= b instead of a = a >>> b\na &= b instead of a = a & b\na ^= b instead of a = a ^ b\na |= b instead of a = a | b \n\n[http://www.devguru.com/Technologies/Ecmascript/Quickref/assignment_operators.html]",
