  "Content": "[stevech0:]\n\nWireless Air Link bit rate: with 11g: 54Mbps max. With 11n: same. These rates are achieved only with short distances, few walls, and ideal interference conditions.\n\nWith 11n AND channel-pair-bonding: 108Mbps. But channel pair bonding is (a) rude as it uses 2/3 of the entire shared band and (b) is often automatically disabled if there are any non-11n networks on any of the 12 affected channel numbers. So 11n is great for hermits.\n\nWindows normally reports the Wireless Air Link in the WiFi status. As it will with an ethernet, say, 1Gbps connection but few PCs can push more than 75% of that speed.\n\nA throughput test at the IP layer, which includes all wireless and TCP/IP overhead, will typically show the yield is a bit less than 1/2 of the Air Link rate. This is because of things like 802.11 is half-duplex, waits for an ACK from the receiving side before sending more (unless you use a particular proprietary/non-standard frame bursting), bits lost to error detection and correction overhead, retransmissions due to interference on same/adjacent channels, and so on.\n\nThe WiFi marketing guys prey on the gullible public. As do the lotteries.\n\n[http://www.dslreports.com/forum/\nr21412426-General-WirelessN-Question-Why-am-I-only-getting-65mbps]",
