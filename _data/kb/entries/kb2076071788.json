  "Content": "1.2.2 Servlets\n\nHTTP requests to a Java Application server are handled by Servlets. Servlets provide \"an object-oriented view of the world that makes it easier to develop web applications.\"\n\n\"A standard J2EE web application is, by definition, based on the Servlet API. Servlets run inside a container... The most popular servlet container is Tomcat...\"\n\n\"Sessions are one of the biggest benefits that the Servlet API provides... The Servlet API also provides lots of other goodies, like security, logging, life-cycle events, filters, packaging and deployment... all JSF applications are standard J2EE web applications.\"\n\n\n1.2.3 Portlets\n\nA portlet is the atomic unit of a Web portal. It is a region on a Web page that displays data from remote sources. This is similar to the Microsoft Web Part used in ASP.NET in general and SharePoint Server n particular. The portlet is defined by the Portlet API. It will not be discussed in detail in this book.",
