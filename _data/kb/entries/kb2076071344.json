  "Content": "Every salad must start with the green stuff. You have a variety of greenery from which to choose, such as iceberg lettuce, romaine lettuce, and even spinach. Let's discuss the nutritional content of each:\n\n* Iceberg lettuce: one cup contains five calories, one gram of protein, two milligrams of vitamin C, and 180 IU of vitamin A.\n\n* Romaine lettuce: one cup has ten calories, one gram of protein, and a whopping ten milligrams of vitamin C. It also contains more vitamin A and fiber than iceberg lettuce.\n\n* Spinach: one cup has ten calories, two grams of protein, and calcium, potassium, and vitamin C. Don't forget the color and crunch! Nutritionally speaking, spinach is your best choice.",
