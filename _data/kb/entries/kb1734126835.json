  "Content": "Procedure For Re-calibrating The Battery Gauge\n\nModels Affected: All models running Windows 95/98\n\nSymptom: The battery gauge always reads 0%\n\nResolution: \n\nThe battery gauge on the unit is an estimate only of the true battery charge, therefore can give an inaccurate reading, such as staying at 0% even though the unit has been charging for a long period of time. To re-calibrate the battery gauge, perform the following:\n\nTurn unit off - Remove the battery and the AC adapter. \nLook on the back of the battery for a small white dot. \nPress the white dot with your finger and the meter will light up. This meter shows the true battery charge. \nLeave the computer off for anywhere between 30 seconds to 1 min. \nRe-attach the AC adapter only and turn on the computer. \nAfter the computer has loaded into windows, reinsert the battery. \nWait 15 to 30 seconds for new battery gauge reading. \nIf this does not resolve the problem, our technicians online are available to assist you through the Compaq Support Forum.\n\n\nThis information is subject to change without notice.
