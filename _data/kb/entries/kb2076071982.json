  "Content": "Consider three files each containing one word:\n\n    1.txt\n    2.txt\n    3.txt\n\nThis cat command, cat *.txt, produces the following output:\n\n    One\n    Two\n    Three\n\nwhere each word is the one word in the three text files, respectively. Now we need to store this concatenated output in a compressed gzip file:\n\n     cat *.txt | gzip > out.txt.gz\n\nThis piping is redirected into a *.gz file that contains one file, out.txt. The assumption here today is that this procedure can be used for apache log files generated by, say, vlogger.\n",
