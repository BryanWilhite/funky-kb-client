  "Content": "Just remember the following:\n\n* An event must be of a delegate type\n\n* A delegate may require custom event arguments of a programmer-defined type\n\nSo we see three things to consider when building events: (i) the declaration of the event; (ii) the declaration of the delegate on which the event depends; (iii) the definition of any event arguments specified in the delegate declaration.\n\nFor more on this, see \"Events In C#\" by Sanju:\n\n    http://www.csharphelp.com/archives/archive253.html",
