  "Content": "INSTRUCTIONS ON SETTING UP A SHELL ACCOUNT\nWITH GRAPHICAL WEB ACCESS\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis will give you PPP emulation with access to\nwww, news, mail, and Real Audio on a NETCOM Unix shell account.\n\nThe most recent version of this document is located at\n/ftp/pub/be/beh/setup95.txt\n\nThis How-To is for Windows 95 users.\n\nWindows 3.1 and WFW 3.11 users should use the document located at \n/ftp/pub/be/beh/setup.txt\n\nMac users should use the document located at\n/ftp/pub/tr/trygve/webpages/slirp-and-macppp.txt\n\nThis document is broken into 5 parts\n\na  Setting up SLIRP\nb  Configuring the Windows95 Dial-Up Networking\nc  Installing the Netscape World Wide Web browser\nd  Making it all work!       \ne  Problem solving and other stuff\n\n\nSetting up SLIRP\n\na1. Login to NETCOM\na2. Enter the following commands at the NETCOM prompt:\n    cd\n    ln -s /u2/beh/pub/slirp\n    cp /ftp/pub/be/beh/www/.slirprc95 .slirprc\n    cp /ftp/pub/be/beh/www/ppp95 ppp\n\nNOTE: If your communications program supports Zmodem, use \"sz\"\n    instead of \"sx\" in the next step. Terminal supports \"sx\".\n    You may already have a browser (MS PLUS pack, etc.) and not\n    need this step. This is Netscape 1.0 16-bit. See \"e7\" about 32-bit \n    Netscape.   \n\n    sz /ftp/pub/be/beh/www/ns16-100.exe\n\na3. Type \"slirp\", you should see the message:\n    Slirp v1.0c (RELEASE)\n    Copyright (c) 1995,1996 Danny Gasparovski and others.\n    All rights reserved.\n    This program is copyrighted, free software.          \n    -------------- STUFF DELETED --------------------------\n    [autodetect SLIP/CSLIP, MTU 1500, MRU 1500, 57600 baud]\n    SLiRP Ready ...\na4. Type five zeroes (0) to exit. This should bring you back to the \n    NETCOM prompt. You may have to do this a few times to get to the  \n    prompt. \na5. Type \"ppp\", you should see the message:\n    Slirp v1.0c (RELEASE)\n    Copyright (c) 1995,1996 Danny Gasparovski and others.\n    All rights reserved.\n    This program is copyrighted, free software.      \n    -------------- STUFF DELETED --------------------------    \n    [talking PPP, 57600 baud]\n    SLiRP Ready ...\na6. Because the \"ppp\" file starts Slirp with the \"exec\" command, your \n    shell proccess may have been terminated. You may not be able to\nreturn\n    to the NETCOM prompt with the \"0\"'s thing. If so, just hangup the\nmodem\na7. We have now successfully setup and tested SLIRP.\na8. \"a8\" is for reference. You do not NEED any of \"a8\" for section\n\"b\".\n    Your PPP setings are:\n    IP Address = 10.0.2.15\n    Subnet Mask = 255.255.255.0\n    gateway = 192.100.81.254\n    host name = beh  (your login name, \"beh\" is mine)\n    domain name = netcom.com\n    dns servers = 199.182.120.203 199.182.120.202 (thanks to\nnetcruiser) \n    domain suffix = netcom.com\n    host IP = 10.0.2.2  (use telnet://10.0.2.2 for a local host\nprompt)\n\n    The next 3 items are very useful in setting up Netscape 2.0\n\n    NNTP server = 10.0.2.1  (news server)   \n    SMTP server = 10.0.2.2  (mail server) or smtp.ix.netcom.com\n    POP  server = 10.0.2.2  (post office)\n\nConfiguring the Windows95 Dial-Up Networking\n\nb1.

Leave the Area Code field BLANK. \n      Type in the phone number for your local Netcom access point,\n      putting in any special codes to disable call waiting or to get\nan\n      ouside line.

Single-click the new Netcom icon with the RIGHT mouse button,\nand\n      select Properties. \n   9.

Click OK twice\n\nInstalling the Netscape World Wide Web browser\n(Skip this if you already have a browser, i.e Plus Pack)\n\nc1. Create sub-directory c:\\temp in Windows\nc2. Copy ns16-100.exe to an empty directory\nc3. \"Run\" ns16-100.exe \nc4. \"Run\" setup.exe to install Netscape in the desired directory\n\n\nMaking it all work!\n\nd1.

When your ready to exit NETCOM, close all of your winsock \n    applications (Netscape, Telnet, etc.) and disconnect\n\n\nProblem solving and other stuff\n\ne1. Windows 95 has a very good Telnet program in the Windows\n    directory. After setting it up with \"Options\" in Netscape.\n    Do telnet://10.0.2.2/ to get to a NETCOM prompt. Because we\n    started Slirp with the exec command, you should not receive\n    any \"multiple login\" nasty grams from NETCOM.\ne2. Most pictures on the Web have a higher color resolution than\n    256 colors. Do My Computer -> Control Panel -> Display ->\n    Settings and select a color pallet with higher color resolution\n    for advanced video cards, such as 16 bit. \ne3. If you get hard DNS lookup errors try this\n    http://198.95.249.77/  This is the same as\nhttp://www.netscape.com/\n    If it works, look at your DNS server entries. Use the shell\ncommand\n    \"ping -s\" for other IP addresses to test. Ping is in /usr/etc\ne4. Netcom doesn't support Slirp. Check out \n/ftp/pub/be/beh/policy.txt\n    You should post problems to netcom.shell.general,\nnetcom.shell.www,\n    alt.dcom.slip-emulators newsgroups or e-mail me at beh@netcom.com\ne5. You just can't get Slirp to work. You click on the NETCOM icon, \n    \"Connect\", do \"ppp\", \"continue\", and it just hangs. There may be\nsome \n    values in the \"master\" TCP/IP settings. Do My Computer -> Control\n    Panel -> Network -> TCP/IP -> Properties. There should be no\nentries. \n    Everything should be \"Disable\", \"none\", or \"obtain automatically\".\ne6. If Auto Dial (Plus Pack only feature?) stops working, check that \n    url.dll hasn't been deleted from the windows\\system directory.\n    Sometimes when you un-install Netscape, it will delete this file.\ne7. More goodies:\n\n    My bookmark file on NETCOM (don't \"ftp.netcom.com\", just \"cd\")\n    /ftp/pub/be/beh/bookmark.html\n\n    My Windows 95 dial-up script on NETCOM (for the Plus Pack version)\n    /ftp/pub/be/beh/www/netcom.scp\n\n    Advanced scripting tool URL (same as Plus Pack)\n    http://www.microsoft.com/kb/softlib/mslfiles/dscrpt.exe\n\n    The latest Netscape software URL\n    (1.0 is old 16-bit, get the new 32-bit stuff, 2.0 is super)\n    http://www.netscape.com/\n\n    Real Audio URL (ABC, NPR, VOA are just waiting to be listened to)\n    Version 1.0 and 2.0 should work without modifing the .slirprc file\n    http://www.realaudio.com/\n\n    News Xpress URL (Great for decoding pictures)\n    ftp://ftp.hk.super.net/pub/windows95/wskutil/\n\n    CWS Apps List\n    http://cws.wilmington.net/\n\n    Text files on creating web pages, slirp binaries, I-phone, etc.\n    /u2/beh/pub/how-to\n\n    Widgets for Microsoft Exchange (if you must, ugh)\n    http://www.halcyon.com/goetter/widgets.htm\n\nSpecial thanks to seligman@netcom.com for writing the NNTP program\nthat\nenables us to read NETCOM's news spool. This file is pointed to in the\n.slirprc file and I have put a copy at /u2/beh/pub/nntpd\n\nLast updated 03/15/96\n\nSuggestions and corrections welcomed\nbeh@netcom.com\n\n<OTHER STUFF>\ncd\n rm slirp\n link -s /u1/nuglops/bin/slirp\n\nTo change your NNTPD link (so you can read the NETCOM news spool),\ndo the following at the NETCOM shell prompt\n\n cd\n pico .slirprc\n\n Change the line that is     add exec /u2/beh/pub/nntpd:nntp\n to                          add exec /u13/seligman/bin/nntpd:nntp\n\n<MORE OTHER STUFF>\n\npub/be/beh/setup95.txt\n\na1.
