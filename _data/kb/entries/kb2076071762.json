  "Content": "Allocating 48MB of RAM for an Ubuntu Server VM running a LAMP image is reasonable. 96MB seems more than enough for a single-user development environment. The VM hard drive image should be about 1GB.\n\nThe foremost issue is getting the console display to appear correctly in Virtual PC 2004. Edit /boot/grub/menu.lst to change the first entry in the list of Automagic Kernels such that:\n\n    kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.10-5-386 root=/dev/hda1 ro quiet splash\n\nbecomes\n\n    kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.10-5-386 root=/dev/hda1 ro quiet splash vga=0x314\n\nYou can also hit ESC during the GRUB boot sequence and set vga=0x314.\n\nInstall hung at times. It was probably looking for updates on the network but the virtual networking was not working. This command made ping work as expected:\n\n    sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.254.33\n\nThe IP address in the example above, 192.168.254.33, should be entered in the Windows HOSTS file for machine/netbios name resolution. Edit the HOSTS file here:\n\n    %SystemRoot%\\System32\\DRIVERS\\ETC\\HOSTS\n\nTo install new software, the recommendation here is to use APT. See \"Package management with apt\" here:\n\n    https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGetHowto\n\nAn excellent summarizing source for Ubuntu Linux hardware tips is \"Unofficial Ubuntu 5.10 (Breezy Badger) Starter Guide\":\n\n    http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu#Hardware\n\nThis was useful for understanding, say, how accessing a CD-ROM drive works in Linux.\n\nWhat may prove to be useful is \"Linux Guest Support for Virtual Server 2005 R2\" covered here:\n\n    http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserversystem/\n        virtualserver/evaluation/linuxguestsupport/default.mspx",
