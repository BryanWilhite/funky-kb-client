  "Content": "By Lindsay Edwards \n \nConstipation can be a real discomfort for anyone. There are many foods that act as natural laxatives. Some of the most common natural laxatives include: \n\n* Fiber: it helps to bulk up stools and, when consumed with plenty of water, starts mobility in the intestine. High-fiber foods include whole grains, fruits, peas, and beans. \n\n* Fruit juice: apple, pear, and grape fruit juices are particularly effective in young children because they're high in naturally occurring sugars that are difficult for young intestines to digest. Use only a little of these juices to help with constipation, since they can often cause loose stools and diarrhea. \n\n* Prunes: they naturally stimulate contractions of the intestines to remove waste products. Prunes also attract water to the intestinal area. \n\n* Fluids: drink plenty of fluids to soften stools. Avoid any liquid with caffeine, because caffeine acts as a diuretic. \n",
