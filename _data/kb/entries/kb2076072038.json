  "Content": "No, I wouldn’t say that. What is essential for me is that we are moving forward. Someone has to be take over from the first generation of African filmmakers. We have young filmmakers that are very able on a technical level, but their ignorance concerning the African cultures is frightening. It is not their fault; it is the “ecole française,” the french education they have been given. They are victims of colonialism. If you don’t know a culture to its roots, it is very difficult to express specific purposes or attitudes from inside of a cultural system. Sometimes I hear myself saying that some of our fellows, the new generation of Africans, are not different compared to the people of the diaspora. They live on African territory but nonetheless they ignore African cultures. We, those who had the chance to go to school, we know that what they teach us there involves Greek or Indo-European civilizations, but not a word about African civilizations.\n\n[Previously unpublished.
