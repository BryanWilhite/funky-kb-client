The \nCensus Bureau said Thursday that 56 percent of American \nadults were married and living with their partners in 1998, \ndown from 68 percent in 1970, 62 percent in 1980, and 59 \npercent in 1990. And more to disturb traditionalists: About \n28 percent of children now live with just one parent, a huge \nrise from 1970 when 12 percent were raised by \nsingle parents.",
