  "Content": "A compiled Pass-Through Query in the QueryDefs collection of a DAO database can be referenced in code like the following:\n\n    Set qdDAO = dbDAO.QueryDefs(\"qsptTaz3Test00\")\n    qdDAO.Execute DB_FAILONERROR\n\nwhere \"qsptTaz3Test00\" is the name of the compiled Pass-Through query and \"qdDAO\" is the name of a QueryDef object. Calling the Execute method of the QueryDef object may generate the error, \"Can't Execute a Non-Action Query.\" This error will occur when the Returns Records property of the Pass-Through query is set to Yes.\n\nNote: multiple SQL commands can be placed in an Access Pass-Through query but it is not recommended to mix select statements with SQL that does not return records like update statements.",
