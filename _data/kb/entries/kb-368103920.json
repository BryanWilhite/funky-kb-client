  "Content": "Although too much iron, like too much of many nutrients, can cause problems, too little can leave you with that run-down feeling. \n\nIron is part of hemoglobin, a compound found in red blood cells that transports oxygen from your lungs to your body's cells. The current dietary iron recommendations are 15 milligrams per day for women of childbearing age and ten milligrams per day for everyone else. Women, rapidly growing children, and vegetarians are at greatest risk for iron-deficiency anemia. \n\nAlthough your body absorbs iron better from animal sources, eating iron-rich vegetables with a bit of animal protein or with a food rich in vitamin C aids plant-based iron absorption. On the other hand, calcium, coffee, and tea inhibit iron absorption. \n\nLow-fat animal protein iron sources include: \n\n* 3 oz. lean beef--2 1/2 milligrams \n* 1 dz. large shrimp--2 to 3 milligrams \n* 3 oz. light poultry--1 milligram \n* 3 oz. dark meat--3 milligrams \n* eggs--1 milligram per yolk  \n\nGood plant sources include: \n\n*1/2 cup raw tofu--7 milligrams \n*1 T. blackstrap molasses--3 milligrams \n*1/2 cup lentils--3 milligrams \n*1/2 cup prune juice--1 1/2 milligrams \n*10 dried apricot halves--1 1/2 milligrams \n*1 cup tomato juice--1 milligram",
