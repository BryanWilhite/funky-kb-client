  "Content": "The general form for the file protocol in the Windows environments is:\n\n    file:///<drive letter>|<path>\n\nwhere <path> mimics the Unix-like forward slash ('/') format. So if you are trying to use the Active Desktop with a custom home page that points to local folders on your hard drive, this protocol suddenly becomes useful. This format also works on Netscape browsers in Windows.\n\nFor example, to link to a folder called \"foo\" on drive \"C:\" we have:\n\n    file:///C|/foo",
