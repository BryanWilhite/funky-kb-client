  "Content": "Sometimes, food stays in the refrigerator a little longer than we initially expect. If this often happens to you, then pay attention. There are certain guidelines you should follow to keep food safe, especially when it has passed its prime peak of freshness.\n\nKeep the following guidelines in mind when purchasing and storing fruits:\n\nApples, grapefruit, oranges, and tangerines should be stored uncovered in the refrigerator and should be used within two weeks of purchasing.\n\nBananas should be stored at room temperature and used within two to three days after the green disappears.\n\nGrapes should be stored unwashed and uncovered in the refrigerator and used within four to six days.\n\nLemons and limes should be stored uncovered in the refrigerator and used within ten days to two weeks.\n\nPears should be stored at room temperature until ripe, then stored in the refrigerator crisper. Eat pears within three to five days of purchase.",
