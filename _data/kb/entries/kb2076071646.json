  "Content": "When opening a SQL Server table in DataSheet View from an ADP file, the following error message might appear:\n\n    \"The stored procedure executed successfully but did not return records.\"\n\nThis problem is likely to be caused by an invalid SQL statement stored in an Extended SQL Server property called MS_RowSource assigned to the column of one of the tables in the project. This property can be viewed, edited or removed by the SQL Query Analyzer.
