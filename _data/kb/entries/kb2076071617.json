  "Content": "The assumption here is that, during Microsoft's reactionary quest to address security flaws, someone broke EVENTLOG.DLL. I suspect that my event logs began to disappear after an automatic update from Windows Update. Some guy named Matt posted this on bmonday(dot)com:\n\n\"I had this problem and it only reared its ugly head when I changed the log files to 'Overwrite as needed' because I got fed up of deleting them. So this supports your theory.\"\n\nSo what I did was set all of my logs to Properties > General > Log size > Do not overwrite events (clear log manually). Microsoft recognizes this problem in MSKB article 829246 (\"Event logs are corrupted\") here:\n\n    http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=829246",
