In some cases, selecting another option (e.g. \"Save to Disk\") will reactivate the OK button so you can then reselect the \"Open with\" action to open the file with an application.”\n\nThis was a problem when a PHP page streamed a file from a link with a target attribute of \"_blank\", causing a new window to open.\n\n[http://kb.mozillazine.org/Open_File_dialog_has_the_OK_button_grayed_out]",
