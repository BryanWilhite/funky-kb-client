  "Content": "Using Alt-key combinations for the Tab Control may not work all the time in Access 97. What I have noticed is when the access keys are pressed, the focus does not change but the application \"beeps.\" This problem is intermittent. It appears to work correctly for tabs with fewer controls on them (three controls or less perhaps).\n\nOne work-around for this problem is responding to the KeyDown event:\n\n    Private Sub Form_KeyDown(KeyCode As Integer, _\n        Shift As Integer)\n\n        Dim blnAltDwn As Boolean\n        blnAltDwn = (Shift And acAltMask) > 0\n    \n        With Me\n            If blnAltDwn And KeyCode = vbKeyD Then\n                'Tab Caption: \"Import Ownership &Data\"\n                .pagImport.SetFocus\n            ElseIf blnAltDwn And KeyCode = vbKeyG Then\n                'Tab Caption: \"Build/Edit Ownership &Groups\"\n                .pagGrouping.SetFocus\n            ElseIf blnAltDwn And KeyCode = vbKeyP Then\n                'Tab Caption: \"Build Ownership Re&port\"\n                .pagRpt.SetFocus\n            End If\n        End With\n    End Sub\n\nUsing this code, the beeps eventually stop while the Alt-key combinations are pressed.\n\nMSKB Article Q156222 (\"ACC95: Access Keys Do Not Work with Tabs on TabStrip Control\") states \"Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access 7.0. This problem no longer occurs in Microsoft Access 97.\"",
