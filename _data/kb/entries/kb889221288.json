  "Content": "All replication synchronization data errors are stored in a hidden system table called MSysErrors. It has column (or field name) called RowGUID that can be used in joins with the table generating the error.\n\nThe join between the MSysErrors and the table in question is between the fields RowGUID and s_GUID respectively. This information can be used to build temporary queries in the QDE.\n\nRecall that in order to see system tables like MSysErrors select Tools > Options > Show > System Objects from the Menu Bar.",
