  "Content": "Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 Tools Visual Studio 2008 Extensions, Version 1.2 requires WSS. This may seem obvious or a future version for Visual Studio will have ‘disconnected’ Setup option.\n\nThese were installed:\n\n* Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 with Service Pack 1-x86\n\n* Infrastructure Update for Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 (KB951695)-x86\n\n* Microsoft SharePoint Administration Toolkit v2.0 x86\n\nThe non-Farm (default) install will make a “SharePoint - 80” Web Application that will take over any preexisting IIS site on port 80. The old site will be stopped and its files untouched.\n\nThe default install will generate a SQL Embedded database with this Named Pipe connection:\n\n    np:\\\\.\\pipe\\MSSQL$Microsoft##SSEE\\sql\\query\n\nThis is stored at this location:\n\n    %SystemRoot%\\SYSMSI\\SSEE\\MSSQL.2005\\MSSQL\\DATA\n\nThis (again) might be obvious but SharePoint stores documents as binary BLOBs in a content database. Sheetal Jain explores this in “SharePoint and Large files ( > 1GB) in a Document Library?” here:\n\n    http://office12.blogspot.com/2007/06/\n        sharepoint-and-large-files-1gb-in.html\n",
