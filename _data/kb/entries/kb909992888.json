  "Content": "The Harris Papyrus\n\nI am thy first sister\nAnd thou art to me as the garden\nWhich I have planted with flowers\nAnd all sweet-smelling herbs\nI directed a canal into it\nThat thou mightest dip thy hand into it\nWhen the north wind blows cool\nThe beautiful place where we take a walk\nWhen thy hand rests within mine\nWith thoughtful mind and joyous heart\nBecause we walk together\nIt is intoxicating to me to hear thy voice\nAnd my life depends upon hearing thee whenever I see thee\nIt is better to me than food or drink\n\n\nThe Beautiful Joyous Songs\nof Thy Sister Whom Thy Heart Loves\nWho Walks in the Fields\n\nThe love of my beloved leaps on the bank of the stream\nA crocodile lies in the shadows\nYet\nI go down into the water and breast the wave\nMy courage is high on the stream\nAnd the water is as land to my feet\nIt is her love that makes me strong\nShe is a book of spells to me\nWhen I behold my beloved coming my heart is glad\nMy arms are spread apart to embrace her\nMy heart rejoices forever...since my beloved came\nWhen I embrace her I am as one who is in Incense Land\nAs one who carries perfumes\nWhen I kiss her, her lips are opened and I am merry without beer\nWould that I were her servant who is in attendance on her\nSo should I behold the hue of all her limbs",
