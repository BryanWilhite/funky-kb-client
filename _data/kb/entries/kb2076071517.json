  "Content": "Chapter 4: Utilities Group\n\n* This chapter makes it clear that a completely visual interface makes it difficult to locate tools described with words in the manual. I had a very difficult time locating the Add Regular Polygon tool and the Convert NURBS Patch to polyhedron (or curve to Polygon) tool. I recommend creating a custom configuration for the Configuration Library using the tool repository under the Recycle Bin.\n\n* The Polygon Reduction Tool creates new objects in the same location as the original. So move the new object to see it after it is created.\n\n* The Polygon Reduction Tool works with Level of Detail groups (LOD groups) used in VRML.\n\n* I had to add the Move, Spin and Scale Magnetic Object tools to my custom configuration as they were not found in any of the default configurations.\n\n\nChapter 5: Primitives\n\n* A straightforward read.\n\n* Use the Help Bar and mouse hovering over the various parts of the Magic Ring to be reminded of its functions.\n\n\nChapter 6: Selection and Polygon Edit\n\n* Paint several polygon faces simultaneously by clicking on Paint Face tool in the Material Editor while the faces are selected.\n\n* \"Named selections are stored with the object and scene so you can come back and\nuse these selections throughout multiple sessions.\"\n\n* The section entitled \"Selecting Multiple Objects\" assumes that you are using the Object Tool. This implies that \"rectangle select\" and \"lasso select\" do not refer to the polygon face selection tools in section 6.2.\n\n* \"You have the option to animate almost all Point Edit functions in trueSpace5... Note that vertex-level animation is incompatible with the DynDiv functions.\"\n\n* The Polygon Copy and Polygon Draw tools can create areas on a face that can be textured or extruded apart from the face on which it was drawn.\n\n* The Polygon Slice Tool can work in concert with the Slice by Selected Line/Plane Tool to create a plane for slices. These tools in turn work with the Separate tool to completely remove a sliced section of an object making a new object.",
