  "Content": "By Lindsay Edwards \n \nMagnesium is a mineral that your body cannot live without. Magnesium is important to your body because it plays a part in bone metabolism, helps transmit nerve impulses to muscles, helps transport calcium and potassium, and regulates blood pressure. But where do we get magnesium and how much magnesium do we need in our daily diet? \n\nMagnesium can be found in drinking water and in many foods, especially nuts, legumes, whole grains, and green vegetables. Magnesium is safe in the appropriate amounts, but when consumed excessively, magnesium intoxication can occur. Symptoms of magnesium intoxication include drowsiness, lethargy, sweating, and slurred speech.",
