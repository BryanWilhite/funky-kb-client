  "Content": "Lesson 2: Using Validation\n\nThe purpose of this lesson is to detail the validation controls in ASP.NET.\n\n* \"Client-side validation is provided by a JScript library named WebUIValidation.js, which is downloaded separately to the client.\"\n\nIt is important to note that the client-side validation features in ASP.NET work only in Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4.0 and later. This is why validation controls automatically provide server-side validation. (Incidentally, the sample Web form Validation1.aspx uses a call to Server.Transfer() that breaks the automatic server-side validation functionality.)\n\nThe validation controls: RequiredFieldValidator, CompareValidator, RangeValidator, RegularExpressionValidator, CustomValidator and ValidationSummary.\n\n* \"A server control can have multiple validators.\"\n\nThe lesson details a problem (in Table 4-7) with the CompareValidator control that can be solved by combining it with a RequiredFieldValidator control.\n\n* \"To let the user cancel validation, provide a Submit HTML control that sets the Page_ValidationActive attribute...\"\n\nClicking on this Submit HTML control will cause a postback and in the Page_Load event procedure below, the variable bln will be false:\n\n    bool bln;\n    if(this.IsPostBack)\n    {\n        this.Validate();\n        bln = this.IsValid;\n    }\n\nThere is a typo in this lesson stating effectively that bln would be true.\n\n* \"Customizing Validation... On the server side, place your validation code in the ServerValidate event procedure... To provide client-side validation, specify a validation script in the CustomValidator control's ClientValidationFunction property.\"\n\nThis may be one of very few places where an external JavaScript file could seamlessly integrate with an ASP.NET Web form design pattern.",
