  "Content": "By Lindsay Edwards \n \nCertain foods can help minimize and shorten the duration of symptoms associated with the common cold. Here are some of the proven cold-fighting foods: \n\n* Chicken soup thins the mucous in the lungs, making the mucous easier to expel.\n \n* Hot and spicy foods act as expectorants. When you eat these foods regularly, they help thin mucous secretions of colds, asthma, and allergies. \n\n* Garlic kills the viruses and bacteria associated with the common cold and flu.\n\n* Drinking plenty of liquids will hydrate the mucous membranes. Viruses thrive in dry environments. ",
