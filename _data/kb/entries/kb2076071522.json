  "Content": "This was the error message that started it all: \"The data was added to the database but the data won't be displayed in the form because it doesn't satisfy the criteria in the underlying record source.\" I was getting this error when I set the RecordSource property of an Access Data Project Form to the name of a SQL Server view that contained joins.\n\nThis problem is similar to the problem resolved by KB article 248095 (\"ACC2000: Error When You Add Record to a Form That Is Based on a Stored Procedure\") which leans heavily toward rolling one's own ResyncCommand string.\n\nBefore resorting this, I recommend setting the UniqueTable property of the form to see if Access can create a ResyncCommand string for you. Entering the name of one table is far less work than trying to create a ResyncCommand value.\n\nFor more philosophy, the details can be found at MSDN, the article \"Chapter 3: Building Microsoft Access 2000 Client/Server Applications\" at:\n\n    http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnapg/html/apg03.asp",
