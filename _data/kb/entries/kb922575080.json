  "Content": "When you are certain that your DLLs for your reference are installed (because, perhaps, you properly used REGSVR32.EXE) but they still show up as \"MISSING...\" in Project > References... list, try editing the .VBP file associated with the project. \n\nClose the project (to be safe, close Visual Basic). Open the .VBP file in a text editor. Remove the lines that begin with \"Reference=*...\" referring to the missing References. Reopen the project file in Visual Basic. Choose Project > References... to select the components that you know are installed.\n\nAs of this writing, Microsoft has a complete discussion of this issue at the following URI:\n\n    http://msdn.microsoft.com/\n        library/devprods/vs6/vb/html/\n            vbconfixingmissingreferences.htm",
