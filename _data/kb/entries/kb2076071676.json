  "Content": "By making your form fully trusted, you can avoid the annoying \"ADO Security Warning\" messages that suggest a communication problem among development teams at Microsoft. You can make your form Fully Trusted by selecting Tools > Form Options > Security. You will then see that you have to sign your form with a Digital Signature. This may be a show stopper but you can generate one just for your machine/domain with the Digital Certificate for VBA Projects tool. For more information about this tool please see:\n\n    http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q217221/\n\nand\n\n    \"Using SelfCert to Create Digital Certificates in a Network Environment\"\n    http://pubs.logicalexpressions.com/Pub0009/LPMArticle.asp?ID=194\n\nAfter you sign the form then go to Tools > Options > General > Security Options and check \"Allow fully trusted forms to have access to files and settings on my computer.\" This should stop ADO error messages but other security messages (especially ones from Internet Explorer) are still out there... lurking...\n",
