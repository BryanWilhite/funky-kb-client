  "Content": "InfoPath is FrontPage for XML documents.\n\nIt serves as a wrapper for BizTalk (thereby actually making BizTalk \"necessary\").\n\nSharepoint Server reads the properties of InfoPath documents, but these \"properties\" are actually the XML nodes of the document itself (thereby finally making document properties useful in Office).\n\nInfoPath can merge multiple XML documents of the same schema into one document in an \"aggregation scenario.\" This functionality can be called from SharePoint.\n\nInfoPath documents can be saved to HTML (or MHTML) but these serve only to \"display\" the form. The HTML is read only: all of the data-entry and interactivity is meant to be available only to InfoPath users. This implies that cross-vendor or cross-platform interoperability is confined to the XML data itself---not user-interface interactivity.",
