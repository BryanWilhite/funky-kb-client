  "Content": "Travelers who fail to take precautions while visiting developing countries can catch more than an eyeful of scenery. \n\nTo get the most out of your visit without the \"bug\" getting the better of you:\n\n* Drink bottled water only. Avoid tap water and ice. \n\n* Order from menus. Avoid buying from street vendors or eating from buffets, which might have been sitting out for several hours under unsanitary conditions. \n\n* Avoid salads and undercooked or raw seafood and meat. \n\n* Eat only peeled fruits and vegetables.",
