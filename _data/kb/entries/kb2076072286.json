For many things in Ubuntu, particularly any time you are tinkering with adding repositories, you need to know your version. If nothing else, it can make you feel a little bit more like you know what’s going on if someone asks you and you actually know what your computer is running ;)\n\nIt’s easy enough to do.\n\n1) Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal\n2) Type the following at the prompt:\ncat /etc/lsb-release\n3) It should output something similar to mine, which looks like this:\nDISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu\nDISTRIB_RELEASE=6.10\nDISTRIB_CODENAME=edgy\nDISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=\"Ubuntu 6.10\"\n\nNot too hard to figure out that the line that says ‘DISTRIB_CODENAME’ is the one that tells you the name of your version.
