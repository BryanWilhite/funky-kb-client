  "Content": "Searching for text with Regular Expressions should be straight forward. I constantly read this reference at design-time:\n\n    ms-help://MS.VSCC/MS.MSDNVS/vsintro7/html/vxgrfregularexpressionss.htm\n\nWhat was elusive to me was how to replace what I found using the Replace All command. This is done by \"tagging\" expressions with brackets {}. So the following regular expression will look for HTML numerical attributes without XHTML-friendly quotes:\n\n    \\=[0-9]+\n\nBut this expression will not let me insert quotes after the equal sign. This expression will:\n\n    {\\=}{[0-9]+}\n\nThis expression works just like the previous one. All we have now are two tagged sub-expressions that can be located with the \\n syntax. The corresponding replace expression is therefore:\n\n    \\1\"\\2\"\n\nThis says, \"Insert a quote after the first set of tagged text characters and another quote after the second set of tagged text characters.\"",
