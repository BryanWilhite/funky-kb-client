  "Content": "When the user mistakenly gives the same names to User Samples, Instruments and Presets, Vienna 2.0 may \"keep the names unique\" by adding 1, 2, 3, etc. after each multiple name. Vienna will also duplicate the samples (adding 1, 2, 3, etc. after each duplicate) increasing the file size of the bank unnecessarily.\n\nTo avoid this and other errors (which may occur when trying to load the bank in the AWE32 Control Panel), use prefixes for each hierarchy. So for a user sample called BASSDRUM, use SMPL_BASSDRUM for the Sample, INST_BASSDRUM for the Instrument and BASSDRUM for the Preset. The Preset name appears in the AWE32 Control Panel.",
