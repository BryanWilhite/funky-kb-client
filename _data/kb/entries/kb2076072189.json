  "Content": "The leaves are commonly used as a leaf vegetable throughout the area of mainland African distribution, including Malawi, Zimbabwe, and the Sahel. They are eaten both fresh and as a dry powder. In Nigeria, the leaves are locally known as kuka, and are used to make kuka soup. The fruit is nutritious possibly having more vitamin C than oranges and exceeding the calcium content of cow's milk. Also known as \"sour gourd\" or \"monkey's bread\", the dry fruit pulp separated from seeds and fibers is eaten directly or mixed into porridge or milk. In Malawi, the fruit pulp is used to make a nutrient-rich juiceâ€¦\n\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adansonia]",
