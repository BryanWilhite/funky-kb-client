  "Content": "The Thunder, Perfect Mind is a poem discovered among the Gnostic manuscripts at Nag Hammadi in 1945.\n\nFor I am knowledge and ignorance.\nI am shame and boldness.\nI am shameless; I am ashamed.\nI am strength and I am fear.\nI am war and peace.\n—The Thunder, Perfect Mind [1]\nFor it is I who am acquaintance: and lack of acquaintance.\nIt is I who am reticence: and frankness.\nI am shameless: I am ashamed.\nI am strong: and I am afraid.\nIt is I who am war: and peace.\n—The Thunder - Perfect Intellect, Lines 26-31 from another translation. [2]\n\nThunder Perfect Mind (the title is, more accurately, The Thunder - Perfect Intellect), takes the form of an extended, riddling monologue, in which an immanent saviour speaks a series of paradoxical statements concerning the divine feminine nature. These paradoxical utterances echo Greek identity riddles, a common poetic form in the Mediterranean. There are some translations to the right from the same section of the poem. Line numbering is different in different translations.\n\n[http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/thunder.html]\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thunder,_Perfect_Mind]",
