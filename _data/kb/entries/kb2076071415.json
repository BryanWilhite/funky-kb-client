This issue can occur if Internet Explorer is trying to locate a proxy server.\n\nIn Internet Explorer 5, Proxy Auto-Discovery is enabled by default, and this feature may make it appear as if Internet Explorer is not responding.\n\nFor more details please see MS KB article Q220902:\n\nhttp://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q220/9/02.asp",
