  "Content": "Don Box loves XPathNavigator because it is based on XPath (http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath) instead of an XML data model.\n\nDon very articulately and humanely explores XPathNavigator in \"Passing XML Data Inside the CLR\" on MSDN TV at:\n\n    http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdntv/episode.aspx\n        ?xml=episodes/en/20030603XMLDB/manifest.xml\n\nHe goes on to explain that instances of XPathNavigator comes from XPathDocument. This is important to me because XPathDocument objects can be passed to Transform() method of an instance of XslTransform.",
