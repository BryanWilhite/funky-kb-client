  "Content": "1.3.1 Why do we need frameworks?\n\n\"Forms are just one example of tasks that servlets and JSP don't completely solve. Web applications have to manage a lot of pages and images, and referencing all of those elements within larger applications can become a nightmare if you don't have a central way of managing it.\"\n\n\"Although JSP provides a simple mechanism for creating a dynamic page, it doesn't provide extensive support for composing a page out of smaller, reusable parts. Other fun things that servlets don't handle include internationalization, type conversion, and error handling.\"\n\n\n1.3.2 She's a Model 2\n\nThe MVC analogy: \"When you watch a story on the news, you view a version of reality. ...The news channel is controlling the interaction between the TV program---the view---and the actual event---the model.\"\n\n\"...most frameworks, including JSF, support some variation of the MVC design pattern.\"\n\n\n1.3.3 JSF, Struts, and other frameworks\n\nJava frameworks have a lot of overlap. A lot of this has to do with the \"open\" nature of Java culture, which could easily be mistaken for a state of affairs just short of total chaos.\n\nThere is the idea that JSF and Struts \"compete\" or that JSF replaces Struts. The lead developer of Struts, Craig McClanahan, also played a large role in the development of JSF. For more details see \"Struts Or JSF? Struts And JSF?\" here:\n\n    http://blogs.sun.com/craigmcc/entry/struts_or_jsf_struts_and\n",
