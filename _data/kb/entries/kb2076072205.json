  "Content": "We want to assign our string value to a variable named $x; that’s why we started things off with $x = followed by @\", the syntax that represents the start of our here-string. (Which, we should add, needs to be on a line all by itself.) We then indicate the end of the here-string by typing the construction \"@, also on a line by itself.\n\nThe cool part, however, is what lies in-between the beginning and the end of the here-string. In between the opening line and the closing line all we have to do is type the string value exactly the way we want it assigned; in turn, PowerShell will respect any line breaks, double and single quote marks, and blank spaces we type in. Suppose we wanted to type each word and punctuation mark on a separate line. In that case, our here-string (or at least the first part of it) would look like this:\n\n$x = @\"\n\"\nCuriouser \nand \ncuriouser\n!\n\"\n\"@\n\nAnd what do you suppose will show up onscreen when we echo back the value of $x? Good guess:\n\n\"\nCuriouser \nand \ncuriouser\n!\n\"\n\nAs you might expect, this is also a nifty way to add comments to a script: you can type as much text as you want any way you want, and without having to comment out each and every line. Here’s a comment that uses a here-string:\n\n$x = @\"\n\nThis script demonstrates the use of \"here-strings.\"\nAnything typed between the top line of this code block\nand the bottom line of this code block will be formatted\nexactly as shown here.\n\n\"@\n\n\n[http://www.microsoft.com/technet/scriptcenter/resources/\n    pstips/jun07/pstip0629.mspx]",
