  "Content": "Eating plenty of broccoli, or simply doubling your intake of fruits and vegetables from five servings a day to ten, can increase the antioxidant power of your bloodstream by about 13 to 25 percent, according to a recent study. \n\nThe study, which was conducted by researchers at the U.S. Department of Agriculture/Agricultural Research Service Center on Aging at Tufts University, examined the effect of fruits and vegetables ranking high in an antioxidant assay called ORAC. Although the role of antioxidants in health and disease prevention is not yet well defined, these active compounds are thought to reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and cataracts. \n\nThe following fruits and vegetables rank highest in ORAC antioxidant power: \n\nPrunes \nRaisins \nBlueberries \nBlackberries \nStrawberries \nRaspberries \nPlums \nOranges \nRed grapes \nCherries \nKale \nSpinach \nBrussels sprouts \nAlfalfa sprouts \nBroccoli florets \nBeets \nRed bell peppers \nOnions \nCorn \nEggplant",
