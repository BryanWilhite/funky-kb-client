  "Content": "From Brad Linder: “Windows Search gives you far more control over which files and folders you want to index. …Windows Search does an excellent job of sorting search results into distinct categories. …Google Desktop, on the other hand just sort of spits everything out at once, without dividing your results up into categories.”\n\n[\n    http://www.downloadsquad.com/\n        2008/03/30/windows-search-4-0-vs-google-desktop-5-5/\n]\n\n“Windows Search (formerly known as Windows Desktop Search or WDS on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003) is an indexed desktop search platform released by Microsoft for the Windows operating system.[1] Windows Search for Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008…”\n\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Search]\n\n“Microsoft Search Server (MSS) is an enterprise search platform from Microsoft, based on the search capabilities of Microsoft Office SharePoint Server. MSS shares its architectural underpinnings with the Windows Search platform for both the querying engine as well as the indexer. Microsoft Search Server was once known as SharePoint Server for Search.”\n\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Search_Server]\n\n“A Microsoft Search Server 2008 or Microsoft Search Server 2008 Express configuration can range from a Basic installation (a stand-alone deployment on a single server) to an Advanced installation that uses multiple servers.”\n\n[http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb905370.aspx]\n\n",
