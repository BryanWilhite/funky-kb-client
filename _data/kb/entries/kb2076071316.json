  "Content": "First of all for expert remarks about equalization see http://www.prorec.com/ where a search for Lionel Dumond finds some articles back in 1998 that are informative. I can only write very basic things like:\n\nEQ is the most important digital effects tool the desktop audio engineer has.\n\nEach instrument in a perfect mix should occupy their own band in the frequency spectrum.\n\nNo sound has one frequency. It is a mixture of frequencies. Almost all sounds contain \"bass\" frequencies ( < 200Hz) because (I assume) they don't require that much energy to generate.\n\nMost of my poorly EQ'd mixes suffer from \"bass build-up\" that sounds dull or \"blurry.\" High frequencies (used properly) give me the feeling of brightness and focus.\n\nI can begin to identify sounds (like a good sound engineer) in terms of its frequency by looking at the five bands of my car stereo equalizer:\n\nDeep bass is around 60Hz; bass is around 250Hz; the \"middle\" (where I think most of the annoying noise can be) is around 1000Hz; \"treble\" sounds begin at 3.5KHz; and the brightest stuff is about 10KHz.",
