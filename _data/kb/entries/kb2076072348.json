  "Content": "Data Binding can be tricky to debug. In this post, I will share the techniques I use to debug WPF bindings, including the new debugging improvements we implemented in the latest 3.5 release. I will discuss the following four techniques:\n\n    * Scanning Visual Studio’s Output window for errors.\n    * Using Trace Sources for maximum control.\n    * Using the new property introduced in WPF 3.5 PresentationTraceSources.TraceLevel.\n    * Adding a breakpoint to a Converter.\n\n…\n\nIf you want to learn more about this topic, I recommend Mike Hillberg’s blog. He wrote the best article I’ve read about Trace Sources, which I use frequently as a reference.\n\n[http://bea.stollnitz.com/blog/?p=52]\n[http://blogs.msdn.com/mikehillberg/archive/2006/09/14/WpfTraceSources.aspx]\n",
