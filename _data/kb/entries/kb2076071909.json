Safe Mode is described here:\n\n    http://us2.php.net/features.safe-mode\n\nThis means that you are not able to test for the existence of a file or directory with a root different from the “allowed path(s).” One way around this problem is to re-factor your PHP code to test for the allowed path(s) when possible.",
