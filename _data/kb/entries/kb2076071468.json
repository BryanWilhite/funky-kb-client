It can take a long time to get this just right since the menus in VS hop around so much in the 2002/2003 release while you are using the product. Assuming you are using the English version of VS your custom menus are saved in the following file:\"\n\n    %USERPROFILE%\\Application Data\n        \\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\7.1\\1033\\CmdUI.PRF\n\n\"You should be able to move this file from machine to machine. Again, this file is written once VS exits. But this time you just close all instances of VS, replace one with the other, open VS and you should be golden.\"",
