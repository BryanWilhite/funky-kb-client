  "Content": "By Lindsay Edwards \n \nAs body cells burn oxygen to produce energy, harmful by-products are produced. These by-products are known as free radicals. Free radicals are missing an electron and will attack any nearby molecule, such as DNA, protein, or fat, to get an electron. Over time, as free radicals attack nearby cells, those cells become damaged. This damage can contribute to premature aging and to diseases such as heart disease, arthritis, and cancer. \n\nAntioxidants are substances intended to neutralize free radicals by giving them an electron. By doing so, antioxidants prevent free radicals from attacking nearby cells and damaging them. Some common antioxidants are beta-carotene and vitamins C and E.",
