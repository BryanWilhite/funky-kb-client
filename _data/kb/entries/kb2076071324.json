  "Content": "For years, people have considered garlic a natural healer. Garlic has been found to lower high cholesterol levels, and it can even have a positive effect on high blood pressure, cancer, and some infections. Some people eat raw garlic instead of taking a garlic supplement. Yet, there's some controversy as to whether eating raw garlic is healthy. \n\nThe majority of studies say that most people can tolerate eating one to two garlic cloves daily. However, garlic in higher doses (more than five cloves per day) can cause gastrointestinal pain. In some studies, garlic lowered blood proteins and caused ulcers in laboratory animals. \n\nIt has even been discovered that garlic, when applied to the skin, causes inflammation, redness, and itching. Can you imagine what it can do to your stomach?",
