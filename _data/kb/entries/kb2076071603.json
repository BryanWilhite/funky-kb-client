  "Content": "* CuteEditor for .NET from CuteSoft.net is a full blown ASP.NET application with several tens of files. I was expecting a little over one file---a compiled assembly or two. I can't see myself maintaining this stuff. The real killer is that this supports IE 5.5+ only.\n\n* r.a.d.editor3.1 from telerik.com is quite expensive and laden with Office Interop. It is DHTML- and JavaScript-based but only recently recognized XHTML. The MSI package created a web root and tried to run sample from my local web server. This did not work with \"object not found\" errors. When they dare charge so much money, I expect flawless idiot-proof installs. Better luck next time. Nice magazine ads.\n\n* XStandard XHTML 1.1 WYSIWYG Editor from XStandard.com has a free version of an ActiveX control that just works. The only immediate drawback is the fact that its an ActiveX control. Immediate gratification for the short term.\n",
