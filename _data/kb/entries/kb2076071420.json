  "Content": "Eventually some under-informed bozo may suggest using a web server to automate Microsoft Office applications. I used to summarily dismiss this talk as another Homer Simpson overdosing on the doughnuts. However, as I get older and more tolerant I realize that I must explore the possibility that this so-called bozo is suggesting that we stream IIS responses back to the client using MIME types based on Microsoft Office formats. In a low-traffic Intranet environment it may not be such a \"stupid\" idea to stream an Excel spreadsheet into a web browser.\n\nThe MS KB article \"INFO: Considerations for Server-Side Automation of Office\" (Q257757) goes into more detail:\n\n    http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q257/7/57.asp\n",
