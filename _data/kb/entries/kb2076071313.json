  "Content": "I feel obliged to apologize before I do this: sorry. Associating VB with Java is pretty nasty. Okay:\n\nVB is all about encapsulating procedures; Java is all about encapsulating data.\n\nVB (as of 6.0) has modules; Java has classes. Java's equivalent of a standard module is to have a class containing the main() method. And, yes, VB has the \"class module.\"\n\nVB has module-level variables; Java has instance fields.\n\nVB has optional parameters; Java has overloading.",
