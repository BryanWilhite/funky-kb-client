  "Content": "I just started with PowerShell to do some complex scripting. As a beginner in this new language I will probably run into all the quirks that the language has, but hey thats the fun with learning something new. The first quirk: calling a function with parameters.\n\n    function f([string]$a, [string]$b)\n    {\n        Write-Host \"a:\", $a, \" b:\", $b\n    }\n\n    f(\"hello\", \"world\") # Results in: a: hello world b:\n    f \"hello\" \"world\" # Results in a: hello b: world\n\nIf you put something between parentheses, it is executed as an expression first.\n\nFor more information on what you can do with functions, execute the following command in your PowerShell: Get-Help about_function\n\n[http://weblogs.asp.net/soever/archive/2006/11/29/\npowershell-calling-a-function-with-parameters.aspx]",
