  "Content": "By Brigitte Mars, for healthshop.com\n\nCayenne pepper, best known for its hot pungent flavor, is an excellent herb for improving circulation. It has been used to stimulate digestion, lower high blood pressure, and increase the excretion of cholesterol. Cayenne is high in vitamins C and E and also contains carotenoids and a substance called capsaicin, which is included in creams, salves, and liniments to block the body's perception of pain. Capsaicin is included in topical formulas to help arthritis and fibromyalgia.",
