I have consistently neglected to include the full path of the office application since the shortcut is to the application file and not the application.\n\nIn the case of Access 2000, this will not work:\n\n    \\\\MyShare\\C$\\Folder\\MySQL.adp ;My Command Parameter\n\nHowever, this will:\n\n    \"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\Office10\\MSACCESS.EXE\"\n        \\\\MyShare\\C$\\Folder\\MySQL.adp ;My Command Parameter\n\nwhere, of course the above two lines should be one line.",
