  "Content": "Okay, so I can't afford near-field monitors. I have two sets of Labtecs. I have the LCS-1030 which has a range from 50Hz to 18kHz and I have the LCS-2414, from 40Hz to 20kHz.\n\nNote that the 1030 has \"Dynamic Bass Equalization - Actively adjusts bass equalization for distortion-free sound at all listening levels\" which \"sounds like\" these \"studio reference\" speakers would be misleading. The 2414 gives no-nonsense low-budget bass.",
