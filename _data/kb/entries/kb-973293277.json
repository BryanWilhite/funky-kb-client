  "Content": "Oxygen and heat easily destroy vitamin C. Because it is a water-soluble vitamin, it can also leach out into cooking liquids. \n\nFoods high in vitamin C include strawberries, citrus juices, red and green peppers, broccoli, kale, Brussels sprouts, and baked potatoes. \n\nTo get the most vitamin C from the foods you buy: \n\n* Eat foods rich in vitamin C raw. \n\n* Store vitamin C-rich fruits and vegetables in the refrigerator and cut just before using. \n\n* Cut food into large, rather than small, pieces to minimize exposure to oxygen. \n\n* Keep cooking times short and use a minimum amount of water in cooking. Steaming and stir-frying are good cooking methods to use. \n\n* Leave skins on potatoes and use some potato cooking water when preparing mashed potatoes. \n\n* Cook vitamin C-rich vegetables in casseroles.",
