  "Content": "Important Concept to Understand:\n\nThe mixer sits between the inputs and the speakers/monitors (outputs). All connections should show an understanding of this concept.\n\n\nImportant Items from the Manual:\n\nMeters (page 9) --- 'AVG' (average) LEDs indicate normal output; 'PK' (Peak) indicate overload.\n\nMic Power (page 9) --- press this button when using condenser microphones.\n\n\nWild Guesses:\n\nCalibrate the mixer's peak level against the \"red\" levels of the computer's level meters (software). I generated a sound that peaks at -6dB and adjusted levels on the mixer to \"almost\" go into the red when this sound is playing.\n\nUse the Pre-Amp knobs before resorting to volume knobs: keep volume at zero.\n\n\nUnwanted Noise:\n\nSo far I am very pleased with this tool. The only time I heard it hum was when I set the Power Pack (AC Adapter) too close to the main console. So now I try to keep the Power Pack away from the main console.",
