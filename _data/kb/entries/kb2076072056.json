  "Content": "The JavaScript language currently does not provide a good way to distinguish between objects and arrays. The typeof operator is broken: It identifies arrays as objects. Comparing a value's constructor property doesn't work because arrays created in a different frame will have a different constructor. There are do-it-yourself tests for arrayness, but they are complicated and unreliable.\n\nMark Miller of The Google, by closely reading the ECMAScript standard, has discovered a simpler, more reliable test.\n\n    Object.prototype.toString.apply(value) === '[object Array]'\n\n[http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-TBPekxc1dLNy5DOloPfzVvFIVOWMB0li?p=916]",
