  "Content": "Do not trivialize or underestimate the importance of VBA in Visual Basic 5.0. Every default VB project must contain the following libraries:\n\nVisual Basic for Applications (VBA; VBA5.DLL)\nVisual Basic Runtime Objects and Procedures (VBRUN; MSVBVM50.DLL)\nVisual Basic Objects and Procedures (VB; VB5.OLB)\n\nMany VB users are surprised to find out how much of VB is in VBA. For example, the Err object is instanced by the class VBA.ErrObject. Most of the VBRUN library are constants. Classes that instance controls make up a large part of the VB library. Almost everything else is in VBA.",
