  "Content": "Netscape Navigator cannot share the default colormap with other X applications as it uses so many colors. This problem shows up when running Navigator and other windowing applications at the same time: when shifting focus from one window to another the window losing focus may flash and lose its color (change to black and white). By using the netscape -install option you can force Navigator to use its own color map. (This may cause more problems so keep in mind the -no-install command line option as well!)\n\nFor a complete list of Navigator command-line options refer to the following URL:\n\nhttp://help.netscape.com/kb/client/960514-75.html",
