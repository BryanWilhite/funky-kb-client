  "Content": "It seems that locking the CDE while logged in as root (or equivalent) prevents unlocking the CDE. I have had to use Stop A to restart the system (which is not a good idea). One work-around is to login as a user and then \"su\" to a super-user shell. When the CDE is locked it will be locked by the user login and not the \"su'ed\" super-user session.",
