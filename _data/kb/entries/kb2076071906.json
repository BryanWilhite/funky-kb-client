  "Content": "* “The current APIs for accessing XML documents either serially or in random access mode are, respectively, SAX and DOM…”\n\n* “The XSL standard has two parts, XSLT (the transformation standard, described next) and XSL-FO (the part that covers formatting objects, also known as flow objects).”\n\n* “A DTD can’t restrict the content of elements, and it can’t specify complex relationships.”\n\n* “…a DTD uses syntax which substantially different from XML, so it can’t be processed with a standard XML parser. That means you can’t read a DTD into a DOM, for example, modify it, and then write it back out again… To remedy these shortcomings, a number of proposals have been made for a more database-like, hierarchical \"schema\" that specifies validation criteria. The major proposals are shown below… RELAX… SOX… TREX…”\n\n* “The following standards aim at preserving the benefits of HTML in the XML arena, and to adding additional functionality, as well… XLink… XML Base… XPointer…”\n\nKnowledge standards: RDF (Resource Description Framework), RDF Schema, XTM (XML Topic Maps)…\n\nExtended document standards: SMIL (Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language), MathML (Mathematical Markup Language), SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics), DrawML (Drawing Meta Language)…\n\neCommerce standards: ICE (Information and Content Exchange), ebXML (Electronic Business with XML), cxml (Commerce XML), CBL (Common Business Library)…\n",
