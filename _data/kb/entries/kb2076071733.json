  "Content": "Lesson 1: Building a Web Application\n\nThis lesson quickly introduces the concepts of the meta-data associated with .NET assemblies and the configuration of automatic assembly compilation with \"build options.\"\n\n* \"Web applications have two build options: debug and release.\"\n\nIt may be better to remind us that Visual Studio solutions have two, default, build options: Debug and Release. Other configurations can be added. For more, see \"Default and Custom Builds\" at:\n\n    http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/\n        vsintro7/html/vxconprojectbuilds.asp\n\nProject-level build options in the Property Pages dialog can be set for additional control over the build process.\n\n* \"The application's build option and Web.config setting should agree. There is no advantage in having one set to debug and the other set to release...\"\n\n* \"To identify your application, open the AssemblyInfo file and enter the application's information in the assembly attributes.\"\n\nThese declarative attributes should not be confused with similar procedural properties in the System.Windows.Forms.Application class.\n\n",
