    <h3>Hibernate in Action Notes: Chapter 1; Understanding object/relational persistence; 1.1 What is persistence?</h3>

<pre>
<p>1.1 What is persistence?</p>
<p>&quot;To use Hibernate effectively, a solid understanding of the relational model and SQL is a prerequisite.&quot; Here is a list of SQL terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data Definition Language (DDL): CREATE, ALTER</li>
<li>Data Manipulation Language (DML): INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;There are many reasons why SQL databases dominate the computing industry. Relational database management systems are the only proven data management technology and are almost always a requirement in any Java project.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;However, for the last 15 years, developers have spoken of a paradigm mismatch.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Almost all Java applications contain a mix of persistent and transient objects; hence we need a subsystem that manages our persistent data.&quot; This &quot;subsystem&quot; requires a &quot;domain model.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An application with a domain model doesn't work directly with the tabular representation of the business entities; the application has its own, object oriented model of the business entities.&quot;</p>
