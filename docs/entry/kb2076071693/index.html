<section class="entry">

    <p>Lesson 3: Interoperating with COM</p>
<p>The purpose of this lesson is to expand upon the backwards-compatibility feature set of .NET to include COM &quot;interop.&quot; This lesson makes explicit the relationship .NET has with legacy technologies like VB6. It may help to mention that COM stands for component object model, where the word &quot;component&quot; often indicates the physical boundary in which properties and procedures reside (effectively, this means a .DLL file).</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;When you add a reference to a COM object, Visual Studio automatically generates an interop assembly for the object and places it in the project's /bin folder.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>This assembly can be viewed with Intermediate Language Disassembler (ILDASM.exe). For more information, see &quot;VS.NET Tools: Intermediate Language Disassembler(ILDASM)&quot; at:</p>
<pre><code>http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/vsnet/IldasmTool.asp
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Visual Basic 6.0 allowed you create COM properties (Property Let procedures) that were assigned by reference. Visual C# won't recognize those properties.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>This looks like yet another very subtle difference between VB.NET and C#.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Visual Studio can automatically generate type library information and register a .NET class library assembly for use from COM. These automatic tools do not work for ASP.NET Web applications.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>One could argue that ASP.NET applications are already interoperable with COM by default since Internet Information Server must still have COM interfaces at least up to version 6.0.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;The ComVisible attribute allows you to select which public .NET classes and members are included in the generated type library.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>One design pattern shown in the lesson sets the entire assembly to 'hidden' with:</p>
<pre><code>[assembly: ComVisible(false)]
</code></pre>
<p>so that members can &quot;opt in&quot; to COM visibility.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;.NET handles errors through exception classes. COM handles errors through 32-bit data types called HRESULTs.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Managed exceptions under COM are mapped to the appropriate HRESULT and vice versa.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;COM requires objects to be created before use, so it does not support .NET Shared/static members.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>This limitation stands out foremost for managed code running under COM among the lack of support for construtors with parameters and &quot;shadow&quot; members not being callable.</p>
