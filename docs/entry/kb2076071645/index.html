    <h3>Web Service Exception: &quot;The type System.Collections.Hashtable is not supported because it implements IDictionary.&quot;; System.NotSupportedException</h3>

<pre>
<p>Over two years ago, Dare Obasanjo explained to us why an ASMX exception can occur when a type implements IDictionary. In &quot;XML Serialization in the .NET Framework&quot; Dare writes, &quot;The XmlSerializer cannot process classes implementing the IDictionary interface. This was partly due to schedule constraints and partly due to the fact that a hashtable does not have a counterpart in the XSD type system. The only solution is to implement a custom hashtable that does not implement the IDictionary interface.&quot; The rest of this article, as of this writing, is here:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Using the [NonSerialized()] attribute to hide members that cannot be serialized does not appear to avoid this problem.</p>
