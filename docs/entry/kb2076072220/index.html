<section class="entry">

    <p>Even though Microsoft has done a great job on improving the user interface in SharePoint 2007, some things are still buried and require a little “black magic” to get done. In this entry I’ll show you how to enable anonymous access on your site.</p>
<p>First, you need to enable anonymous on the IIS web site (called a Web Application in SharePoint land). This can be done by:</p>
<pre><code>* Launching Internet Information Services Manager from the Start -&amp;gt; Administration Tools menu
* Select the web site, right click and select Properties
* Click on the Directory Security tab
* Click on Edit in the Authentication and access control section
</code></pre>
<p>Instead we’ll do it SharePoint style using the Central Administration section:</p>
<pre><code>* First get to your portal. Then under “My Links” look for “Central Administration” and select it.
* In the Central Administration site select “Application Management” either in the Quick Launch or across the top tabs
* Select “Authentication Providers” in the “Application Security” section
* Click on the “Default” zone (or whatever zone you want to enable anonymous access for)
* Under “Anonymous Access” click the check box to enable it and click “Save”
</code></pre>
<p>NOTE: Make sure the “Web Application” in the menu at the top right is your portal/site and not the admin site.</p>
<p>You can confirm that anonymous access is enabled by going back into the IIS console and checking the Directory Security properties.</p>
<p>Now the second part is to enable anonymous access in the site.</p>
<pre><code>* Return to your sites home page and navigate to the site settings page. In MOSS, this is under Site Actions – Site Settings – Modify All Site Settings. In WSS it’s under Site Actions – Site Settings.
* Under the “Users and Permissions” section click on “Advanced permissions”
* On the “Settings” drop down menu (on the toolbar) select “Anonymous Access”
* Select the option you want anonymous users to have (full access or documents and lists only)
</code></pre>
<p>Now users without logging in will get whatever option you allowed them.</p>
<p>A couple of notes about anonymous access:</p>
<pre><code>* You will need to set up the 2nd part for all sites unless you have permission inheritance turned on
* If you don’t see the “Anonymous Access” menu option in the “Settings” menu, it might not be turned on in Central Admin/IIS. You can manually navigate to “_layouts/setanon.aspx” if you want, but the options will be grayed out if it hasn’t been enabled in IIS
* You must do both setups to enable anonymous access for users, one in IIS and the other in each site
</code></pre>
