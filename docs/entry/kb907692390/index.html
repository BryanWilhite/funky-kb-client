    <h3>SPARCstation 5; PROBLEM: Can't Unlock the CDE</h3>

<pre>
<p>It seems that locking the CDE while logged in as root (or equivalent) prevents unlocking the CDE. I have had to use Stop A to restart the system (which is not a good idea). One work-around is to login as a user and then &quot;su&quot; to a super-user shell. When the CDE is locked it will be locked by the user login and not the &quot;su'ed&quot; super-user session.</p>
