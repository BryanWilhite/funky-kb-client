    <h3>Actually Treating a Form (with HasModule = True) as a Class</h3>

<pre>
<p>It was difficult for me to unify my understanding of my user-defined classes with the idea of a Form as a class. I used to draw a blank when I saw that Access calls a form code module a &quot;Class Module.&quot; But now I have an understanding:</p>
<p>The code behind forms is not only continually compliled (assuming Compile on Demand is enabled under Tools &gt; Options... &gt; Coding Options) but it is also continually instantiated. User defined classes are not so lucky as they must be Set with the keyword New before they create objects.</p>
<p>An unbound text box control in a form with a Class Module should be thought of as a class Property of type Variant. This implies that this Form is the graphical interface of an instantiated class. So an unbound text box in a form without a class module (HasModule = False) is truly unbound. But a form that has a module implicitly &quot;binds&quot; its text boxes to referable memory locations for the duration of its instance.</p>
