    <h3>JavaScript: “The Miller Device”; Identifying an Array; Douglas Crockford</h3>

<pre>
<p>The JavaScript language currently does not provide a good way to distinguish between objects and arrays. The typeof operator is broken: It identifies arrays as objects. Comparing a value's constructor property doesn't work because arrays created in a different frame will have a different constructor. There are do-it-yourself tests for arrayness, but they are complicated and unreliable.</p>
<p>Mark Miller of The Google, by closely reading the ECMAScript standard, has discovered a simpler, more reliable test.</p>
<pre><code>Object.prototype.toString.apply(value) === '[object Array]'
</code></pre>
