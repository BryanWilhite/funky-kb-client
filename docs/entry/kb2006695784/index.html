<p>In many financial applications text files are sometimes needed for automated input of data. Some data feeds are text files containing fixed-width columns. Oftentimes these columns are right-justified with the form:</p>
<pre><code>XXX123
X12345
XXX234
</code></pre>
<p>where the X's are spaces forming a six-character, fixed-width column. If you are building this column from data in a database you will have to &quot;pad&quot; leading spaces. For our six-character column we can use the Format$() function:</p>
<pre><code>VBA.Format$(strData, &amp;quot;@@@@@@&amp;quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>where strData contains the data from the database.</p>
