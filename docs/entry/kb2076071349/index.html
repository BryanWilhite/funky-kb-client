    <h3>PROPER HYDRATION</h3>

<pre>
<p>Do you know how to tell when your body needs fluids? Most people would say that their body needs water when they feel thirsty. They drink a glass of water and go on their way. The fact is, however, that by the time your body feels thirsty, it's already excessively low on fluid.</p>
<p>Keeping your body properly hydrated is important for maintaining good health. There are several activities that can stimulate thirst, one of which is eating. Most foods consist of water, and the salts in food help your body absorb water.</p>
