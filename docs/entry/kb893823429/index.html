<p>WINNT.BMP and WINNT256.BMP are located in the folder assigned to %SystemRoot%. To change the default startup logo, change these files. The pixel dimensions of the file is limited by the resolution of the display.</p>
<p>To see any changes to the startup logo, restart the system. Logging on as &quot;another user&quot; does not guarantee a change to the logo.</p>
