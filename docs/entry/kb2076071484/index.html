    <h3>T-SQL: Flippant Remarks about Table Aliases and the Self Join</h3>

<pre>
<p>Up until shortly before the writing if this article, I considered the use of table aliases just a matter of style. Since I enjoy writing (for humans) I preferred using table names instead of something like:</p>
<pre><code>USE pubs
SELECT
    p.pub_id
,   p.pub_name
FROM
    publishers AS p
</code></pre>
<p>I have no trouble writing out &quot;publishers.&quot; However, I find myself forced to use table aliases when I need to project two or more sets of data in the same table. This is related to the so-called &quot;self-join&quot; which can be used to, for example, find out the authors in Oakland, California who live in the same ZIP Code:</p>
<p>USE pubs
SELECT DISTINCT
au1.au_fname
,   au1.au_lname
FROM
authors au1
,   authors au2
WHERE
au1.zip = au2.zip
AND
au1.city = 'Oakland'
AND
au1.au_id &lt;&gt; au2.au_id</p>
<p>Note the AS clause is omitted from the FROM clause (just a matter of style).</p>
