<p>Everyone has heard of the notorious &quot;tea time&quot; in England. It seems a simple life to invite your friends and family over for some tea and catch up on the times. But, the English may know exactly what they're doing when it comes time for tea.</p>
<p>A recent study has found that one cup of tea per day may cut the chance of a heart attack by 44 percent. A group of 340 men and women who had suffered a heart attack were compared to those of a similar profile who had not suffered a heart attack. The study concluded that the flavonoids found in tea were the reason for the good news.
Flavonoids are nutrients that act as antioxidants to ward off the deterioration of cells and keep dangerous free radicals away from the walls of blood vessels. Flavonoids also keep cells from clotting.</p>
