    <h3>Sonic Foundry Vegas Video 3.x: Generated Text Media Has Limited Character Set</h3>

<pre>
<p>It appears that the Text Media Plug-in for Vegas 3.x does not support extended characters like typographic (or smart) quotes and dashes. This must be a bug as the characters display in the FX window but do not appear in Preview or render properly</p>
<p>However the &quot;legacy&quot; text generators support these characters (even though they do not appear in their respective FX windows).</p>
