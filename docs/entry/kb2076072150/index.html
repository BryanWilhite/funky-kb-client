<p>Visual Studio projects provide two options for handling resources: they can be linked (the default) or embedded. You can have both linked and embedded resources in a single project. However, most of the time you will want to choose one option for all resources in your project.</p>
<p>Linked resources are stored as files in the project; during compilation the resource data is taken from the files and added to the manifest for the application. The application's resource file (.resx) stores only a relative path or link to the file on disk.</p>
<p>With embedded resources, the resource data is stored directly in the .resx file in a text representation of the binary data. In either case, the resource data is compiled into the executable file.</p>
<p>You can change resources from linked to embedded by changing the Persistence property for the resource file.</p>
