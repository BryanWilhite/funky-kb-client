    <h3>PROBLEM: Linked Table from Remote Database Can't Show Records; Rows with &quot;#Error&quot; Shown</h3>

<pre>
<p>When an Access .MDB is linked to a table from a remote database (e.g. SQL MS Server) that is known to be valid (not dropped or locked) and the rows in the table are full of &quot;#Error&quot; strings then try to SELECT * from the table via an Access Pass-Through Query. If you get an error like &quot;Record too large&quot; then the table you are linking to has columns that exceed the 2K limit reserved for the &quot;data page.&quot;</p>
<p>To avoid this problem, delete the linked table and use a Pass-Through Query that shows the only fields you need. For more information, as of this writing, Microsoft touches upon this issue in their Knowledge Base article &quot;DOC: Additional Jet Database Record Size Information&quot; (Q198660):</p>
