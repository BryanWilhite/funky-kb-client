<p>Listening with headphones it may be possible to detect a faint FM-like tone and white noise when no sounds are being played. This is due to the noise generated by the sound card itself. This noise is quantified by the Signal-to-Noise ratio of the card. PC soundcards typically have much worse signal to noise ratio (around 80 dB) than CD players (&gt;90 dB).</p>
<p>To reduce this background noise, open the Creative Mixer and select Input/Output Options. Set all gain values to X1.</p>
<p>Another reason to reduce output gain values is distortions in sound synthesis. For example, certain notes in an instrument sound out of tune. This is called &quot;aharmonic distortion.&quot;</p>
