    <h3>Windows 2000 PROBLEM: Event logs are empty; &quot;Event logs are corrupted&quot; (MSKB 829246)</h3>

<pre>
<p>The assumption here is that, during Microsoft's reactionary quest to address security flaws, someone broke EVENTLOG.DLL. I suspect that my event logs began to disappear after an automatic update from Windows Update. Some guy named Matt posted this on bmonday(dot)com:</p>
<p>&quot;I had this problem and it only reared its ugly head when I changed the log files to 'Overwrite as needed' because I got fed up of deleting them. So this supports your theory.&quot;</p>
<p>So what I did was set all of my logs to Properties &gt; General &gt; Log size &gt; Do not overwrite events (clear log manually). Microsoft recognizes this problem in MSKB article 829246 (&quot;Event logs are corrupted&quot;) here:</p>
