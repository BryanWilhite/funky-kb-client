<p>MSDN: “Several questions have come up lately regarding whether SQL Server Express is an appropriate product to be used in a hosting environment.”</p>
<p>“All versions of SQL Server including Express Edition are RECOMMENDED for dedicated (single-tenant) hosting environments.”</p>
<p>“There is a tool called the Database Publishing Wizard (it comes bundled with Visual Studio 2008) to help the export/import process.”</p>
