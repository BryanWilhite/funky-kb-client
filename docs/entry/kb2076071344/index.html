    <h3>THE BEST SALAD--PART 2 OF 4</h3>

<pre>
<p>Every salad must start with the green stuff. You have a variety of greenery from which to choose, such as iceberg lettuce, romaine lettuce, and even spinach. Let's discuss the nutritional content of each:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Iceberg lettuce: one cup contains five calories, one gram of protein, two milligrams of vitamin C, and 180 IU of vitamin A.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Romaine lettuce: one cup has ten calories, one gram of protein, and a whopping ten milligrams of vitamin C. It also contains more vitamin A and fiber than iceberg lettuce.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spinach: one cup has ten calories, two grams of protein, and calcium, potassium, and vitamin C. Don't forget the color and crunch! Nutritionally speaking, spinach is your best choice.</p>
</li>
</ul>
