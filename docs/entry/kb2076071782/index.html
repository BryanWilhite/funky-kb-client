<p>To disable System Beep sounds in Windows, the &quot;safe&quot; method is to try Tweak UI. Look under General &gt; Settings. Uncheck the Beep on errors box.</p>
<p>As of this writing, Tweak UI is available here:</p>
<pre><code>http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/
    powertoys/xppowertoys.mspx
</code></pre>
<p>The other method that is guaranteed to work (but may strangely enough require reboot) uses the Device Manager. First select View &gt; Show hidden devices. Then look under Non Plug and Play Drivers for Beep. Disable Beep and reboot (when prompted).</p>
<p>By the way, the command-line way to call the Device Manager is this:</p>
<pre><code>%SystemRoot%&amp;bsol;&amp;bsol;System32&amp;bsol;&amp;bsol;DEVMGMT.MSC
</code></pre>
