<p>SQL Server Agent jobs can revert back to their previous owner. This can produce the error: “Unable to determine if the owner (DOMAIN\\xxx) of job &lt;JOB_Name&gt; has server access (reason: error code 0x534. [SQLSTATE 42000] (Error 15404))”</p>
<p>Ultimately the sysdtspackages90 table might need updating. The following SQL statements help:</p>
<p>--See who owns which packages
SELECT
name
,   description
,   suser_sname(ownersid)
FROM
msdb.dbo.sysdtspackages90</p>
<p>/*
Now we update the owner to an appropriate domain account. Either the service account or a generic admin account is good.
*/</p>
<p>UPDATE msdb.dbo.sysdtspackages90</p>
<p>SET
OWNERSID = SUSER_SID('YOUR_DOMAIN\\APPROPRIATE_ACCOUNT')
WHERE
OWNERSID = SUSER_SID('YOUR_DOMAIN\\OLD_ACCOUNT')</p>
<p>Andrew Calvett writes, “It turns out that when you save a change to a maintenance plan the job owners are reset to the owner of the maintenance plan. The owner of the maintenance plan will be the account used to connect to the server in SSMS when creating the plan.”</p>
