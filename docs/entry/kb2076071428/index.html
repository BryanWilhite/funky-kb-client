<p>Chapter 1: This is a satisfactory tutorial. No complaints.</p>
<p>Chapter 2: User Interface</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make sure that the UI matches that in the manual by loading &quot;ts5 configuration&quot; from the Configuration Library.</p>
</li>

<p>Right-click on the New Perspective View Tool to choose a solid or wire frame rendering. This feature applies to all auxiliary windows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click and hold on the Object Tool to show the Global Panel Tool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click and hold on the Draw Object as Solid Tool to show all real-time rendering tools. These options are also available via the Global Panel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The View Navigation tools only appear auxiliary windows under the default &quot;ts5 configuration&quot; settings. You can add these tools via the repository in the Recycle Bin Tool (right-click on it).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can toggle between axes while dragging the edge of the Object Selector by right-clicking.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Chapter 3: Projects &amp; Libraries</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Almost all end-user customizations are stored in libraries. These libraries can then be &quot;wrapped up&quot; into a Project. By default, trueSpace copies pre-existing libraries into the Project folder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Share a Library among multiple projects by selecting File &gt; Load &gt; Library...</p>
</li>
</ul>
