    <h3>Book: Access 97 Power Programming; Chapter 3 Highlights (1/3): &quot;Working with Application Collections And Data Access Objects&quot;</h3>

<pre>
<p>Declaring a Collection Variable</p>
<p>A user-defined collection is a new instance of a collection object. Its &quot;instancing&quot; requires the New keyword. The abbreviated way of declaring a new collection object has the form:</p>
<pre><code>Dim &amp;lt;my collection object variable&amp;gt; as New Collection
</code></pre>
<p>e.g.</p>
<pre><code>Dim colExample as New Collection
</code></pre>
<p>This form is useful at procedure level in the code module. However the non-abbreviated way of delcaring any new object uses two statements instead of one. The first statement is in the declarations section of the module:</p>
<pre><code>Public p_colExample as Collection
</code></pre>
<p>This object variable is now avaible for use and re-use throughout the application. At the procedure level, we can Set this variable equal to a New Collection:</p>
<pre><code>Set p_colExample = New Collection
</code></pre>
<p>Although this appears redundant, it is now possible to quickly destroy the contents of a collection with the code:</p>
<p>Set p_colExample = Nothing</p>
<p>Now this collection object variable can be reused in other modules.</p>
<p>Index Numbers in Collections</p>
<p>Intrinsic Access collections are 0-based while user-defined collection indices are 1-based.</p>
<p>For a detailed discussion of how collections differ from arrays, please see &quot;Creating Custom Collections&quot; (pg. 67) and &quot;Comparing Custom Collections to Arrays&quot; (pg. 70).</p>
<p>The Access Object Model</p>
<p>The Access Object Model is a containment hierarchy that begins with the Application object. Please see &quot;Accessing the Access Object Model&quot; (pg. 73). Here are some noted methods of the Application object:</p>
<p>Application. Echo
Application.GetOption
Application.SetOption</p>
<p>The Screen Object</p>
<p>The Screen object is of the Application object. Here are some noted properties of the Screen object:</p>
<p>Screen. ActiveForm
Screen.ActiveReport
Screen.ActiveControl
Screen.PreviousControl</p>
<p>Note that there is no need to specify the Application keyword in code within Access.</p>
