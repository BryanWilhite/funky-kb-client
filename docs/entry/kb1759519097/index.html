<p>The general form for entering Explorer commands from the console is</p>
<pre><code>Explorer [/n][/e][,/root,&amp;lt;path or UNC&amp;gt;][[,/select],&amp;lt;object&amp;gt;] 
</code></pre>
<p>where:</p>
<p>/n opens Explorer with object view only;</p>
<p>/e opens Explorer with tree view and object view at the current folder;</p>
<p>/root,&lt;path or UNC&gt; opens Explorer at the specified root level;</p>
<p>/select,&lt;object&gt; specifies which object (a file, folder or volume) gets the focus. The select parameter may not work in certain IE4 installations.</p>
<p>Some &quot;stupid&quot; Explorer tricks:</p>
<pre><code>Explorer ..
</code></pre>
<p>will open Explorer one directory above the current directory.</p>
<pre><code>Explorer 
</code></pre>
<p>will open Explorer at the root directory (usally C:\\).</p>
<p>Note that most of these commands also apply to Shortcuts and the Run dialog as well. One Explorer command that works only in the Run dialog consists of a single period (&quot;.&quot;). The &quot;period command&quot; is the same as Explorer \\.</p>
