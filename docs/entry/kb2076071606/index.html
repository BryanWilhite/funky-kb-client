<p>The VSWebCache folder is located here:</p>
<pre><code>%HOMEDRIVE%&amp;bsol;&amp;bsol;Documents and Settings&amp;bsol;&amp;bsol;%USERNAME%&amp;bsol;&amp;bsol;VSWebCache
</code></pre>
<p>The recommendation is to periodically clean this folder out by deleting everything in it (when Visual Studio is not running).</p>
