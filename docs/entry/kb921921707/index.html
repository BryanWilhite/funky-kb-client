    <h3>Maslow's Needs</h3>

<pre>
<p>Almost 60 years ago, psychologist Abraham Maslow developed his &quot;hierarchy of needs,&quot; which explained what motivates people. According to Maslow, people can achieve their needs for self-actualization and psychological happiness only after they fulfill their basic survival and security needs, that is, money, food and shelter.</p>
