    <h3>SQL: The Differences Beteween HAVING and WHERE</h3>

<pre>
<p>When HAVING appears in a SQL statement, this implies that there is a GROUP BY clause in the statement. If WHERE is also in the statement, the WHERE clause creates the first subset. The HAVING clause makes a &quot;second pass&quot; after the GROUP BY clause and makes a sub-sub-set.</p>
