<p>Microsoft does a great job warning users that Replication Design Masters will be significantly larger in size than MDB files not in a Replication set. What is not underscored (at runtime) is the fact that the Tools &gt; Replication &gt; Synchronize Now... command will cause all MDBs involved in synchronization to grow in size as well.</p>
<p>Compating the database helps but does not reduce the size of the database file to the size it was before replication. Here is a real-world example: to synchronize a change in one record in a Replica set all MDBs grow over ~100KBs! Running the compact command after synchonization may shave up to ~50KB off this size increase. I can only assume that this growth in file size is due to data being written to the hidden tables created by Replication.</p>
