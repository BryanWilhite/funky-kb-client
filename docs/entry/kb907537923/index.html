<p>Be aware of the values of App.Path. It can be in long file name format or short file name format. The file name format can be lost when the File &gt; Open command is not used to open a Visual Basic Project file (*.VBP).</p>
<p>Screen.Fonts(&lt;index&gt;) returns system fonts names not font objects. This is an array (for now) not a collection.</p>
<p>Be aware of the TypeName() function and the VarType() function. They are useful for finding sub-types of Variants.</p>
<p>frm.Unload removes UI but not module-scope variables from memory. Set frm = Nothing removes all Form attributes of frm from memory.</p>
