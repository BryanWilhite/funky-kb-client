    <h3>Gerald Horne, Race War!; Chapter 2: The Asiatic Black Man?; Conservative George Schuyler, His Pro-Japanese Leanings; p. 49</h3>

<pre>
<p>Yet this pro-Tokyo bent was not unique to Black Nationalism. The iconoclastic and militantly anti-communist black journalist, George Schuyler, who proudly called himself “conservative,” also bowed in the direction of the Rising Sun. He wrote a roman clef that posited “race war” as a major theme. He was “fascinated by Japan and by the meaning to blacks worldwide of its great military expansion. At the invitation of the <em>[Pittsburgh] Courier</em> he wrote a series of articles on the subject that the publisher found too pro-Japan to be printed.”</p>
