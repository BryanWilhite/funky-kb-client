    <h3>PROBLEM: Tab Control Does Not Recognize Alt-Key Combinations</h3>

<pre>
<p>Using Alt-key combinations for the Tab Control may not work all the time in Access 97. What I have noticed is when the access keys are pressed, the focus does not change but the application &quot;beeps.&quot; This problem is intermittent. It appears to work correctly for tabs with fewer controls on them (three controls or less perhaps).</p>
<p>One work-around for this problem is responding to the KeyDown event:</p>
<pre><code>Private Sub Form_KeyDown(KeyCode As Integer, _
    Shift As Integer)

    Dim blnAltDwn As Boolean
    blnAltDwn = (Shift And acAltMask) &amp;gt; 0

    With Me
        If blnAltDwn And KeyCode = vbKeyD Then
            'Tab Caption: &amp;quot;Import Ownership &amp;Data&amp;quot;
            .pagImport.SetFocus
        ElseIf blnAltDwn And KeyCode = vbKeyG Then
            'Tab Caption: &amp;quot;Build/Edit Ownership &amp;Groups&amp;quot;
            .pagGrouping.SetFocus
        ElseIf blnAltDwn And KeyCode = vbKeyP Then
            'Tab Caption: &amp;quot;Build Ownership Re&amp;port&amp;quot;
            .pagRpt.SetFocus
        End If
    End With
End Sub
</code></pre>
<p>Using this code, the beeps eventually stop while the Alt-key combinations are pressed.</p>
<p>MSKB Article Q156222 (&quot;ACC95: Access Keys Do Not Work with Tabs on TabStrip Control&quot;) states &quot;Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access 7.0. This problem no longer occurs in Microsoft Access 97.&quot;</p>
