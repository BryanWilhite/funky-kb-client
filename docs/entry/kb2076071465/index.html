    <h3>CD-ROM: Flippant Remarks about AutoPlay for Windows Systems</h3>

<pre>
<p>So far my only concern is to get Windows CD-ROMs to load HTML files automatically as investing in other Win32 binaries is beyond my scope. Microsoft addresses this issue somewhat historically in &quot;How can I make a CD-ROM load an HTML file automatically when the disk is inserted into the drive?&quot; at:</p>
<pre><code>http://www.microsoft.com/msj/0499/win32/win320499.htm
</code></pre>
<p>While this is a great reference, I have simply copied Microsoft's own way of auto-loading HTML files by examining a few of the promotional CD-ROMs I have received from them over the years. Their &quot;internal&quot; way of doing it seems to be more exhaustive, covering Alpha-based systems (the entire NT family). This is a bit of an overkill but (flippantly) here we are.</p>
