<p>Flippantly speaking, View State is Session State that does not timeout. It is independent of the server and, as Hilton Giesenow says, &quot;it uses up more bandwidth but less memory.&quot; Simultaneously, it is recognized on the server with the same design patterns for Session state.</p>
<p>View State is serialized to the page requested per user and vanishes when the browser closes. See Hilton's Blog, &quot;ViewState vs Session State vs...&quot; here:</p>
