            <h3>Open Source Office Applications: Flippant Remarks about AbiWord 2.014</h3>
<section class="entry">

    <p>I am a Microsoft guy for historical and practical reasons---not for ideological reasons. When some Oracle guy has a smart remark, I say, Hey, smarty slacks, back in the early 1990s when I was learning SQL I could not walk into an Office Depot and pick up a $99 Oracle database (with that special, software-laundering, anti-trusting &quot;competitive upgrade&quot; price). But I could get my hands on Microsoft products and this got me hooked---the MS Borg assimilated another victim.</p>
<p>Now that my Office Depot days are over, here comes MSDN Universal Subscriptions via my W2 labors---so now I'm on the harder stuff and from my W2 point of view, I am getting Microsoft software &quot;for free.&quot; So why would I care to write about AbiWord, this Open Source fledgling?</p>
<p>Well, Microsoft employees can console themselves by considering my flippant remarks a minority opinion (in every sense of the term) but I don't think I am suffering from a terminal case of brown-eyed myopia when I say that MS Office is a bloated nebula of COM objects---composed of balls of strange orange gas and truly stellar objects. The gassy part of MS Office is really starting to stink when I think of my data as cross-platform XML data sets---and I am writing this sentence being fully aware of InfoPath and the XML features in Word 2003. So when I hear that AbiWord can read and write XHTML, I sit up and take notice. Unfortunately, these are the first few AbiWord bullets flying past my head:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>AbiWord 2.014 provides no way to edit http: or mailto: hyperlinks that I can see, coming from a Microsoft Word perspective (which means I right-click on the hyperlink and I see a command like Edit Hyperlink). This non-feature alone drives me away from AbiWord 2.014.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The toolbars in AbiWord 2.014 are out of the early 1990s. Don't take me back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Features that resemble replacing-text-as-we-type (Auto-Correct or Intelli-Sense) does not appear to be in AbiWord 2.014. And I say this while seeing the Insert &gt; AutoText command in AbiWord 2.014.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The kerning and hinting information of the default font in the Windows version of AbiWord 2.014 does not appear to be recognized. Inconveniences like these may be beyond AbiSource control. I am aware of how hostile Microsoft can be to its competitors big and small.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I see nothing in AbiWord 2.014 that handles XML Schema information. I do not think that AbiWord 2.014 is designed from the ground up to be part of an XML workflow. Microsoft is trying to begin to start thinking about tinkering with XML-based products but the design goals at Microsoft are preoccupied with domination instead of integration (and of course another patch Tuesday is coming up).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The main point of this rant is that I am completely unaware of a tool that is as convenient as a Word processor but it also is a built for rich data interchange. With MS InfoPath the price of entry is having a definite schema in mind. With MS Word 2003 you don't need to have a definite schema to get started (you can add that later), but the formatting of your document effectively---by default---belongs to Microsoft. Out of the box, Microsoft Word 2003 will allow you to interchange your raw text data with a custom schema but it will not let you interchange your formatting information with a custom schema---and I say this with the letters WORDML dancing in my head. I suppose you can &quot;schema-tize&quot; your formatting but the temptation to write your own code is not far away (and I am well beyond tempted). This limitation is unacceptable and as long as Microsoft pays little or no attention to this &quot;minority problem&quot; I will keep my brown eyes on tools like AbiWord.</p>
