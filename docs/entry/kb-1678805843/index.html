<p>Aside from watching food labels for sodium content, try these simple tips for controlling your sodium intake:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dietitians teach that if a food has twice as much sodium as it does calories, then it's probably too much sodium.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't trust your taste buds. Many foods with a high sodium content do not, in fact, taste salty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Unlearn&quot; your taste buds for sodium. Focus on enjoying the other flavors in foods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take a break from the salt shaker. Just one-fourth teaspoon of salt contains a whopping 600 milligrams of sodium.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rinse off canned vegetables before eating them. You can cut sodium intake by 40 percent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limit other condiments that are high in sodium, like soy sauce, mustard, ketchup, and tartar sauce.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some over-the-counter medications contain sodium, such as laxatives, headache pills, and alkalizers. Your doctor can better inform you, especially if you have salt-related high blood pressure.</p>
</li>
</ul>
