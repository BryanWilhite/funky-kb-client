    <h3>Windows 2000 PROBLEM: Domain Controller Does Not Allow Domain Users to Log on Locally; secedit
</h3>

<pre>
<p>By default only account operators, administrators, backup operators, print operators, server operators, Internet guest account, and Terminal Services user account are assigned the right to log on locally to a Windows-based domain controller.</p>
<p>Microsoft describes in detail how to edit the Default Domain Controllers Policy from the Microsoft Management Console in &quot;Assign 'Log On locally' Rights to Windows Domain Controller&quot; (MS KB Article Q234237). But what escaped me was to make the changes take effect immediately. This console command makes the changes take effect immediately:</p>
<pre><code>secedit /refreshpolicy machine_policy
</code></pre>
