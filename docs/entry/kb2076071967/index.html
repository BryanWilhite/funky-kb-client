    <h3>KLV: Jhn 12:8 on Poverty; A Verse in the Bible Used to Justify the Existence of Poverty</h3>

<pre>
<p>KLV Jhn 12:8 “For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.”</p>
<p>The “you” in the sentence refers to Judas (Jhn 12:4). This is a character this is firmly invested in the material system, Roman rewards. Clearly the poor will be with Judas always.</p>
