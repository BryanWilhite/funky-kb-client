<p>The following Registry Keys must be Merged from a properly formatted *.REG file:</p>
<pre><code>HKEY_USERS
    &amp;bsol;&amp;bsol;.DEFAULT&amp;bsol;&amp;bsol;Control Panel&amp;bsol;&amp;bsol;Keyboard
        &amp;quot;InitialKeyboardIndicators&amp;quot;=&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;

HKEY_CURRENT_USER
    &amp;bsol;&amp;bsol;Control Panel&amp;bsol;&amp;bsol;Keyboard
        &amp;quot;InitialKeyboardIndicators&amp;quot;=&amp;quot;2&amp;quot; 
</code></pre>
<p>Note that InitialKeyboardIndicators is of type REG_SZ (string). It has been said that this procedure may not work as planned. The opinion here is that this setting does not force an &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot; state. I assume that it is saving the state that the Numlock Key is in before the user logs off.</p>
