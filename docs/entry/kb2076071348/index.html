    <h3>WHY YOU SHOULD EAT FRUITS AND VEGETABLES</h3>

<pre>
<p>Several studies have proven that a diet rich in fruits and vegetables helps prevent cancer. Specifically, eating more fruits and vegetables helps reduce the risk of esophageal, stomach, colon, rectum, and lung cancers. Of the more than one million new cases of cancer to be diagnosed this year, as many as 35 percent of these cases will be diet related. The recommended daily allowance for fruits and vegetables is
five or more servings per day. Yet, only one-fourth of the American population eats this recommended amount.</p>
<p>Want some tips to help get your intake of fruits and veggies on the upswing? Try some of this simple advice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eat a fruit snack daily.</li>
<li>Add vegetables to your meat entree.</li>
<li>Drink fruit juice at meal times.</li>
<li>Top hot or cold cereals with fresh fruit.</li>
<li>Add extra vegetables to your salad.</li>
</ul>
