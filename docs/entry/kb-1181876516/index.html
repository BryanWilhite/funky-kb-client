<p>Soybeans are an important food and nutritional source for Asians, but they are rarely consumed by Americans. Instead, Americans use soy primarily to feed livestock, despite its nutritional value. Soybeans contain 25 percent oil, 24 percent carbohydrates, and 50 percent protein. Soybeans are also rich in minerals, amino acids, and vitamins. Soy is usually safe for consumption by all, except for those allergic to it. It's known for having a cardiovascular benefit because it decreases LDL-cholesterol levels significantly.
