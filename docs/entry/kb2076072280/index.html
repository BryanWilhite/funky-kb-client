<p>I want to access the music collection on our big Windows XP-running game-playing desktop PC from my recycled Linux laptop down in the basement. I found a lot of information on connecting to a Linux file server from a Windows client, but not much on going the other way round. A bit here, and bit there, and this is what I came up with.</p>
<p>First, edit your /etc/hosts file and give the Windows machine a name:</p>
<p>192.168.1.2   pootie</p>
<p>Next, install the samba and smbfs packages using your method of choice.</p>
<p>Create a directory where the share will appear on your local filesystem.</p>
<p>$ sudo mkdir /mnt/music</p>
<p>Edit /etc/fstab and add a line for the mount. Here “pootie” is the name of the machine and “music” is the name of the share.</p>
<p>//pootie/music  /mnt/music  cifs exec,credentials=/etc/cifspw 0 0</p>
<p>Create a password file /etc/cifspw with the login credentials for your Windows account.</p>
<p>username=Jason
password=ImNotGonnaTellYouThat</p>
<p>And secure the file:</p>
<p>$ sudo chmod 600 /etc/cifspw</p>
<p>Giddyup.</p>
<p>$ sudo mount -a</p>
