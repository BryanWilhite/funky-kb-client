<p>1.4 Components Everywhere</p>
<p>&quot;A software component is a unit of composition with contractually specified interfaces and explicit context dependencies only. A software component can be deployed independently and is subject to composition by third parties [Szyperski].&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In essence, the context is the container for all of the components. A container is a system that hosts components and provides a set of services that allow those components to be manipulated.&quot;</p>
<p>This manipulation can be at design time (in the IDE) or runtime (in the application server).</p>
<p>&quot;A UI component, or control, is a component that provides specific functionality for interacting with an end user. Classic examples include toolbars, buttons, panels, and calendars.&quot;</p>
