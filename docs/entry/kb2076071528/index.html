<p>Microsoft readily reminds us that &quot;correlated subqueries&quot; can be included in the WHERE clause:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT au_lname, au_fname
FROM authors
WHERE 100 IN
   (SELECT royaltyper
   FROM titleauthor
   WHERE titleauthor.au_ID = authors.au_id)
</code></pre>
<p>This form is discussed in detail here:</p>
<pre><code>http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/acdata/ac_8_qd_11_67lc.asp
</code></pre>
<p>But what is not mentioned is that these sub-queries are supported in the SELECT projection list like the following:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT DISTINCT
    title_id
,   au1 = (
        SELECT
            au_id
        FROM
            titleauthor
        WHERE
            au_ord = 1
        AND
            title_id = t.title_id
    )
FROM
    titleauthor AS t
</code></pre>
<p>It is an error to use a sub-query that returns more than one row of data. This form is discussed in detaail in &quot;The Practical SQL Handbook&quot; (a link to the book should be listed on this page at songhaysystem.com).</p>
