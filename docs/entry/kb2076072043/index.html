    <h3>PHP Zend Framework Exception: “Cannot send headers; headers already sent”</h3>

<pre>
<p>It is important to remember that this exception is thrown when there is a blank line at the top of the PHP script.</p>
<p>Martin Burger: “I am so sorry for bothering you all. Needless to say, there was an empty line in one of my included scripts (pretty much at the and of a long chain of includes...)”</p>
