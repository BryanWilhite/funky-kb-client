    <h3>FRUITS AND VEGGIES CAN BOOST YOUR ANTIOXIDANT STATUS</h3>

<pre>
<p>Eating plenty of broccoli, or simply doubling your intake of fruits and vegetables from five servings a day to ten, can increase the antioxidant power of your bloodstream by about 13 to 25 percent, according to a recent study.</p>
<p>The study, which was conducted by researchers at the U.S. Department of Agriculture/Agricultural Research Service Center on Aging at Tufts University, examined the effect of fruits and vegetables ranking high in an antioxidant assay called ORAC. Although the role of antioxidants in health and disease prevention is not yet well defined, these active compounds are thought to reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and cataracts.</p>
<p>The following fruits and vegetables rank highest in ORAC antioxidant power:</p>
<p>Prunes
Raisins
Blueberries
Blackberries
Strawberries
Raspberries
Plums
Oranges
Red grapes
Cherries
Kale
Spinach
Brussels sprouts
Alfalfa sprouts
Broccoli florets
Beets
Red bell peppers
Onions
Corn
Eggplant</p>
