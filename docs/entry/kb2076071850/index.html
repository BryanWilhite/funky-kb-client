<p>Use the System Configuration Utility (msconfig.exe) to stop Adobe Photo Downloader (apdproxy.exe) from loading. Uncheck the box next to apdproxy.exe under Startup &gt; Startup Item. This will cause Windows to switch into Selective Startup mode and the next time you reboot a message to this effect will be displayed. You should be able to disable this message.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can use Tweak UI to remove Adobe Photoshop Album Starter Edition as an AutoPlay handler under My Computer &gt; AutoPlay &gt; Handlers.</p>
<p>Adobe Photo Downloader may appear again in the System Notification Area when the ‘relevant’ Adobe product is launched.</p>
