    <h3>Creative Labs AWE32: Voyetra MIDI Orchestrator Plus; Using AWE Control Panel Effects in a Score; Vienna Sound Fonts, Level 2</h3>

<pre>
<p>Since AWE Control Panel Effects (like Room 3 and Plate) are global effects they are not useful when you only want one or two tracks to have Panning Delay. A solution would be to record that particular instrument with the Control Panel effect (using a WAV file recorder) and then load it in a SF2 sound bank. Level 2 Sound Fonts support stereo samples.</p>
