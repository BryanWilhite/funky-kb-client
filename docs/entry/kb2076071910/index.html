<p>Melanin is present in brain cells, neurons, in many different sites throughout the brain. The Melanin found in such sites is known as neuromelanin. (Graham, D.G., On the Origin and Significance of Neuromelanin, Arch. Pathol Lab. Med. 103: pp. 359–362, 1979; Lindquist, N. G., Neuromelanin and its Possible Protective and Destructive Properties, Pigment Cell Research 1: pp. 133–136, 1987; Bazelon, M. Studies on neuromelanin. 1. A melanin system in the human adult brainstem. Neurology, 17: pp. 512–519, 1967; Fenichel, G. M., Studies on neuromelanin. II. Melanin in the brainstem of infants and children.
