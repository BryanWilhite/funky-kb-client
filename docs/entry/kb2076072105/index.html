<p>“There are two Windows ports that I know of: DeltaCopy and cwRsync. They both are packages which bundle the Cygwin version of rsync with the needed DLLs (cygwin1.dll, and so on). Cygwin is an emulation layer for Windows which allows to create a Linux-e environment and run / compile many of the tools available for Linux without modification.”</p>
<p>An attempt was made to use rsync with a remote server (using the UNC format, \\\\MyServer) and was not very performant.</p>
