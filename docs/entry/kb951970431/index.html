    <h3>ZINC</h3>

<pre>
<p>By Lindsay Edwards</p>
<p>Zinc is an essential element found in every cell of the human body.
Zinc plays many roles in enabling growth and development and promoting general good health. Zinc is necessary to help manufacture proteins and genetic material, stimulate hair growth, develop taste perception, and assist in hormonal activity.</p>
<p>Most of the zinc in the typical American diet comes from animal products such as meat, liver, and seafood, especially oysters. You can also find zinc in other food sources such as whole-grain cereals and nuts, although the zinc in these sources isn't as easily absorbed as the zinc in animal products.</p>
<p>The recommended daily allowance for zinc is 15 milligrams per day for men and 12 milligrams per day for women. Because the typical American diet provides ten to 15 milligrams of zinc per day, the average person will consume the recommended amount. However, since the major source of zinc is animal products, vegetarians are at risk for zinc deficiencies. These deficiencies can result in poor growth, difficulty in wound healing, loss of appetite, and skin problems.</p>
