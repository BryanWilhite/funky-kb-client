    <h3>Cheikh Anta Diop, Civilization or Barbarism; Chapter 12: Characteristics of Political and Social African Structures and Their Effect on Historical Movement; European Translation of “the ascent of King Unas” to Compare with the Lord’s Supper; pp. 183–184</h3>

<pre>
<p>Diop accepts a European translation, Otto Muck, Cheops et la Grande Pyramide (opus citatum, pp. 85–86), of a funerary text, written because of “King Unas.” The French citation itself comes from another European source.</p>
<p>Diop needed a phrase like “it is King Unas who eats men and lives off the Gods” in order to show that, “This text is the most ancient written document that makes the study of vitalistic practices possible that would lead to the myth of the man-eating sorcerer, in today’s Black Africa. They are to be compared with the Osirian rites (see p. 312) and with the Christian Eucharist.”</p>
