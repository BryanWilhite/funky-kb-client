    <h3>COLORFUL KEYS TO ANTIOXIDANTS IN FOOD</h3>

<pre>
<p>To bump up the amount of protective antioxidants in your diet, head to your grocery's produce department and let your eyes be your guide.</p>
<p>The pigments that make carrots and winter squash orange and tomatoes red are part of a group of antioxidant compounds known as carotenoids.</p>
<p>Carrots and winter squash are orange, the color of beta-carotene. Beta-carotene has been recognized for many years as a precursor of vitamin A, which helps prevent night blindness.</p>
<p>Dark-green leafy vegetables, such as kale, spinach, mustard greens, collard greens, and turnip greens, are rich in lutein and zeaxanthin.</p>
<p>High intakes of these two carotenoids have been linked with a decreased risk of age-related blindness due to macular degeneration.</p>
<p>Although these compounds also exhibit the characteristic deep yellow to dark orange color of carotenoids, their color is overwhelmed by the plentiful amount of dark-green chlorophyll in these plants. Lycopene, another carotenoid, is responsible for the deep red-orange of tomatoes. Until recently, lycopene was thought only to be a pigment.</p>
<p>But, it is now being heavily studied as a possible anti-cancer compound.</p>
<p>Vitamin C is also a strong antioxidant and is thought to play a role in reducing cataract risk in aging women. Citrus fruit, berries, tomatoes, peppers, and leafy greens all provide vitamin C.</p>
<p>So, call your mother and tell her she was right. You really do need to eat your vegetables.</p>
