    <h3>GETTING THE MOST OUT OF THE VITAMIN C-RICH FOODS YOU EAT</h3>

<pre>
<p>Oxygen and heat easily destroy vitamin C. Because it is a water-soluble vitamin, it can also leach out into cooking liquids.</p>
<p>Foods high in vitamin C include strawberries, citrus juices, red and green peppers, broccoli, kale, Brussels sprouts, and baked potatoes.</p>
<p>To get the most vitamin C from the foods you buy:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Eat foods rich in vitamin C raw.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Store vitamin C-rich fruits and vegetables in the refrigerator and cut just before using.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cut food into large, rather than small, pieces to minimize exposure to oxygen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep cooking times short and use a minimum amount of water in cooking. Steaming and stir-frying are good cooking methods to use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leave skins on potatoes and use some potato cooking water when preparing mashed potatoes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cook vitamin C-rich vegetables in casseroles.</p>
</li>
</ul>
