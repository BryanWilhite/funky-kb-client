    <h3>Microsoft Word to XML Converters, Flippant Remarks</h3>

<pre>
<p>Don Box stopped working on an XSL transform of WordML to XHTML.</p>
<p>Microsoft WordML to HTML XSL Transformation appears to have vanished from the Download Center and is probably buried in the MSIE-only Word 2003: XML Viewer (wmlview.exe). However, this guy, Oleg Tkachenko, has his own version of the XSLT file here:</p>
<pre><code>http://www.tkachenko.com/dotnet/files/Word2HTML-1.0.zip
</code></pre>
<p>He journals the mysterious behavior of Don Box in &quot;On transforming WordML to HTML again&quot; here:</p>
<p>http://www.tkachenko.com/blog/archives/000153.html</p>
<p>What's left out there are expensive tools that convert entire files to XML and even a web site where DOC files can be uploaded and converted to DocBook format. Most of these designs avoid intimate contact with the automation features of Word. Most are one-way tickets out of the Word format. I need a bit more flexibility.</p>
<p>John E. Simpson, surveys the tools out there in &quot;From Word to XML&quot; here:</p>
