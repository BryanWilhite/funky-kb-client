<p>Don Box stopped working on an XSL transform of WordML to XHTML.</p>
<p>Microsoft WordML to HTML XSL Transformation appears to have vanished from the Download Center and is probably buried in the MSIE-only Word 2003: XML Viewer (wmlview.exe). However, this guy, Oleg Tkachenko, has his own version of the XSLT file here:</p>

<p>He journals the mysterious behavior of Don Box in &quot;On transforming WordML to HTML again&quot; here:</p>

<p>What's left out there are expensive tools that convert entire files to XML and even a web site where DOC files can be uploaded and converted to DocBook format. Most of these designs avoid intimate contact with the automation features of Word. Most are one-way tickets out of the Word format. I need a bit more flexibility.</p>
