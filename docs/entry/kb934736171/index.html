    <h3>FROM A TO ZINC</h3>

<pre>
<p>By Brigitte Mars, for healthshop.com</p>
<p>Zinc is an important nutrient, but studies show that up to three quarters of Americans are zinc deficient, getting only 8 to 10 milligrams daily of a nutrient that is needed in doses of 15 mg daily.</p>
<p>When zinc lozenges are sucked on in the early stages of a cold, the duration and cold symptoms are reduced. Besides combating cold rhinoviruses, zinc inhibits several other viruses, including Herpes Simplex. Good sources of zinc include oysters, meat, eggs, seafood, black-eyed peas, tofu, and wheat germ.</p>
