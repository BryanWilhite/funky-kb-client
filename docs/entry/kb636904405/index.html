<p>At this time in my life, I find it convenient to debug my ASP pages directly in the web browser window. This probably comes from my &quot;traditional&quot; building of ASP pages with only a text editor. I am sure I am missing out on the code breaking features of Visual InterDev. But for now, when I want to see the contents of a variable (e.g. vReturn), I would use the following lines of code:</p>
<pre><code>Response. Write &amp;quot;My Variable: &amp;quot; &amp; vReturn
Response.End
</code></pre>
<p>These lines are placed in the same manner that VB's Stop statement was heavily used in the &quot;old days.&quot; And they should be feared in the same way as well!</p>
<p>Another more subtle technique is to Write HTML comments with the form:</p>
<pre><code>Response. Write &amp;quot;&amp;lt;!-- My Variable: &amp;quot; &amp; vReturn &amp; &amp;quot;--&amp;gt;&amp;quot;
</code></pre>
