<p>Routing requests</p>
<p>Again, these rules direct all requests to index.php, except specified file types:</p>
<p>RewriteEngine on
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule !\\.(js|ico|txt|gif|jpg|png|css)$ index.php</p>
<p>Handling file and directory exceptions</p>
<p>These rules (used immediately prior to the RewriteRule above) exclude real files and directories from the rewriting and lets them pass through unaffected:</p>
<p>RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d</p>
<p>You can also simply allow a specified group of files to pass through unaffected by using this line:</p>
<p>RewriteRule  ^(foo|bar).*  - [L]</p>
<p>In this case, files foo.* and bar.* will be accessed normally.</p>
