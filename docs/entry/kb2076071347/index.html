    <h3>DIET AND PROSTATE CANCER</h3>

<pre>
<p>The exact cause of prostate cancer is still unknown. However, research is being conducted on the correlation between diet and prostate cancer.</p>
<p>Men who consume a diet high in fat have been reported to have higher levels of testosterone, which could increase their risk of developing prostate cancer. It is still unclear, however, whether this relationship is derived from meat fat or dairy fat.</p>
<p>What is known is that there are foods you can eat to inhibit prostate cancer. One such food is soy. Preliminary research shows that men who drink soymilk more than once per day have a lower risk of prostate cancer. Tomatoes also offer some protection against prostate cancer, as do nutritional supplements containing zinc, beta-carotene, vitamin C, and calcium.</p>
