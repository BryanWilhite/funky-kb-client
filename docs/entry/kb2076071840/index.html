    <h3>William H. Grier and Price M. Cobbs, Black Rage; Chapter III: Achieving Womanhood; Grier and Cobbs on Negro Ugliness; pp. 52</h3>

<pre>
<p>The Negro woman’s black face, African features, and kinky hair are physical attributes which place her far from the American ideal of beauty, and make her, with reference to the American ideal, ugly. When the feeling of ugliness is reinforced by the rejection of family and society, the growing girl develops a feeling not only of being undesirable and unwanted but also of being mutilated—of having been fashioned by Nature in an ill-favored manner.</p>
