    <p>NIGHT IN NIJINSKY (Version 1)</p>
<p>ballon and faune
yes
the yoke of the erg
the birth, and now there is the annular ligament
attachment
the firmament under the pivot
the geometric perfection
the contrapose
the crystallized spectre of the rose
they are eating
a suckling for mother
a 'little jap' for the boys
a young, feral ferrule for an old man
an aging ghost for this woman
kitajec</p>
<p>withdrawn and gone
down
iris into orbit
the trip, and across the equator
crossing over to the other side
in aloneness remembering the cross and God
with a crucified mind
to align, assembl√©
the heaven chaine
or marionette strings
for the Clown of God
kitajec</p>
<p>NIGHT IN NIJINSKY (Version 2)</p>
<p>a black cloud like wire
hung down the soft of the arms
the broken nerves of a tired will
hands lateral to the pivot of the hips
men have touched before
hear the voices outside the dressing room door
dressed to kill
fathers of my Femmka</p>
<p>and all the soldiers
squeezed their faces
screaming eye for an eye
dressed to die
singing on the shiny train
war wore on
pressure packed on the brain</p>
<p>the hips
without a scratch
danced with the pain
of a thousand mental wounds
until the last time
in the silk cathedral
by the sweating piano
and chair in which the muscles sat
looked at the people
their faces flat
brothers of my Femmka</p>
<p>and circles are the eyes
the pressure ate through
blacken the eyelids
with the smoke of a world war
there the pederast whore
sin
abomination
bending the pinewood
the stages creak
the curtains drawn
nothing more</p>
<p>but a page at home littered with circles
there was no end no start
just the truth of a set of endless points
for the sons of art
and nobody knew
perhaps Tolstoi
and the crazy dancing boy
Kitajec</p>
