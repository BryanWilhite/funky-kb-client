<p>A compiled Pass-Through Query in the QueryDefs collection of a DAO database can be referenced in code like the following:</p>
<pre><code>Set qdDAO = dbDAO.QueryDefs(&amp;quot;qsptTaz3Test00&amp;quot;)
qdDAO.Execute DB_FAILONERROR
</code></pre>
<p>where &quot;qsptTaz3Test00&quot; is the name of the compiled Pass-Through query and &quot;qdDAO&quot; is the name of a QueryDef object. Calling the Execute method of the QueryDef object may generate the error, &quot;Can't Execute a Non-Action Query.&quot; This error will occur when the Returns Records property of the Pass-Through query is set to Yes.</p>
<p>Note: multiple SQL commands can be placed in an Access Pass-Through query but it is not recommended to mix select statements with SQL that does not return records like update statements.</p>
