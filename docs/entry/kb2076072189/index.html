<p>The leaves are commonly used as a leaf vegetable throughout the area of mainland African distribution, including Malawi, Zimbabwe, and the Sahel. They are eaten both fresh and as a dry powder. In Nigeria, the leaves are locally known as kuka, and are used to make kuka soup. The fruit is nutritious possibly having more vitamin C than oranges and exceeding the calcium content of cow's milk. Also known as &quot;sour gourd&quot; or &quot;monkey's bread&quot;, the dry fruit pulp separated from seeds and fibers is eaten directly or mixed into porridge or milk. In Malawi, the fruit pulp is used to make a nutrient-rich juiceâ€¦</p>
