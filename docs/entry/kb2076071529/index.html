    <h3>InfoPath Beta: Flippant Remarks</h3>

<pre>
<p>InfoPath is FrontPage for XML documents.</p>
<p>It serves as a wrapper for BizTalk (thereby actually making BizTalk &quot;necessary&quot;).</p>
<p>Sharepoint Server reads the properties of InfoPath documents, but these &quot;properties&quot; are actually the XML nodes of the document itself (thereby finally making document properties useful in Office).</p>
<p>InfoPath can merge multiple XML documents of the same schema into one document in an &quot;aggregation scenario.&quot; This functionality can be called from SharePoint.</p>
<p>InfoPath documents can be saved to HTML (or MHTML) but these serve only to &quot;display&quot; the form. The HTML is read only: all of the data-entry and interactivity is meant to be available only to InfoPath users. This implies that cross-vendor or cross-platform interoperability is confined to the XML data itself---not user-interface interactivity.</p>
