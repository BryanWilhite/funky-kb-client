<p>I've been playing with linq to entities also. It's got a long way to go before it catches up with linq to SQL. I've had to use linq to entities for the Table per Type Inheritance stuff. I found a good article recently which explains the whole 1 company 2 different ORM technologies thing here.</p>
<p>However you can do lazy loading, in a way, by doing this:</p>
<p>// Lazy Load Orders
var alice2 = data.Customers.First(c =&gt; c.Name == &quot;Alice&quot;);</p>
<p>// Should Load the Orders
if (!alice2.Orders.IsLoaded)
alice2.Orders.Load();</p>
<p>or you could just include the Orders in the original query:</p>
<p>// Include Orders in original query
var alice = data.Customers.Include(&quot;Orders&quot;).First(c =&gt; c.Name == &quot;Alice&quot;);</p>
<p>// Should already be loaded
if (!alice.Orders.IsLoaded)
alice.Orders.Load();</p>
