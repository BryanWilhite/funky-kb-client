            <h3>Schizophrenia as “Brain Diabetes”</h3>
<section class="entry">

    <p>Some scientists studying schizophrenia have already come up with terms such as ‘cerebral diabetes’, ‘brain diabetes’, pointing to abnormal glucose transport systems across the membranes of brain cells. This comes very close to what we understand hypoglycemia to be, but we would prefer Dr George Samra’s definition of ‘Cerebral Hypoglycia’…</p>

<p>Chances are good that in the midst of all this talk about diabetes, you simply haven't heard much about this condition of hypoglycemia. But that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Indeed, over the years, a number of respected physicians and researchers have found that people with hypoglycemia have reported up to 125 symptoms! …You may be intrigued, as I was, to discover that hypoglycemia has been called the &quot;Great Imitator&quot; because its strange, startling symptoms can mimic a frightening array of diseases and conditions.</p>
