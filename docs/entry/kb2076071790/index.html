    <h3>JavaServer Faces in Action Notes: Chapter 1; Introducing JavaServer Faces; 1.3.1 Why do we need frameworks?; 1.3.2 She's a Model 2; 1.3.3 JSF, Struts, and other frameworks</h3>

<pre>
<p>1.3.1 Why do we need frameworks?</p>
<p>&quot;Forms are just one example of tasks that servlets and JSP don't completely solve. Web applications have to manage a lot of pages and images, and referencing all of those elements within larger applications can become a nightmare if you don't have a central way of managing it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Although JSP provides a simple mechanism for creating a dynamic page, it doesn't provide extensive support for composing a page out of smaller, reusable parts. Other fun things that servlets don't handle include internationalization, type conversion, and error handling.&quot;</p>
<p>1.3.2 She's a Model 2</p>
<p>The MVC analogy: &quot;When you watch a story on the news, you view a version of reality. ...The news channel is controlling the interaction between the TV program---the view---and the actual event---the model.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...most frameworks, including JSF, support some variation of the MVC design pattern.&quot;</p>
<p>1.3.3 JSF, Struts, and other frameworks</p>
<p>Java frameworks have a lot of overlap. A lot of this has to do with the &quot;open&quot; nature of Java culture, which could easily be mistaken for a state of affairs just short of total chaos.</p>
<p>There is the idea that JSF and Struts &quot;compete&quot; or that JSF replaces Struts. The lead developer of Struts, Craig McClanahan, also played a large role in the development of JSF. For more details see &quot;Struts Or JSF? Struts And JSF?&quot; here:</p>
