    <h2>INSTRUCTIONS ON SETTING UP A SHELL ACCOUNT
WITH GRAPHICAL WEB ACCESS</h2>
<p>This will give you PPP emulation with access to
www, news, mail, and Real Audio on a NETCOM Unix shell account.</p>
<p>The most recent version of this document is located at
/ftp/pub/be/beh/setup95.txt</p>
<p>This How-To is for Windows 95 users.</p>
<p>Windows 3.1 and WFW 3.11 users should use the document located at
/ftp/pub/be/beh/setup.txt</p>
<p>Mac users should use the document located at
/ftp/pub/tr/trygve/webpages/slirp-and-macppp.txt</p>
<p>This document is broken into 5 parts</p>
<p>a  Setting up SLIRP
b  Configuring the Windows95 Dial-Up Networking
c  Installing the Netscape World Wide Web browser
d  Making it all work!<br>
e  Problem solving and other stuff</p>
<p>Setting up SLIRP</p>
<p>a1. Login to NETCOM
a2. Enter the following commands at the NETCOM prompt:
cd
ln -s /u2/beh/pub/slirp
cp /ftp/pub/be/beh/www/.slirprc95 .slirprc
cp /ftp/pub/be/beh/www/ppp95 ppp</p>
<p>NOTE: If your communications program supports Zmodem, use &quot;sz&quot;
instead of &quot;sx&quot; in the next step. Terminal supports &quot;sx&quot;.
You may already have a browser (MS PLUS pack, etc.) and not
need this step. This is Netscape 1.0 16-bit. See &quot;e7&quot; about 32-bit
Netscape.</p>
<pre><code>sz /ftp/pub/be/beh/www/ns16-100.exe
</code></pre>
<p>a3. Type &quot;slirp&quot;, you should see the message:
Slirp v1.0c (RELEASE)

-------------- STUFF DELETED --------------------------
[autodetect SLIP/CSLIP, MTU 1500, MRU 1500, 57600 baud]
SLiRP Ready ...
a4. Type five zeroes (0) to exit. This should bring you back to the
NETCOM prompt. You may have to do this a few times to get to the<br>
prompt.
a5. Type &quot;ppp&quot;, you should see the message:

[talking PPP, 57600 baud]
SLiRP Ready ...
a6. Because the &quot;ppp&quot; file starts Slirp with the &quot;exec&quot; command, your
shell proccess may have been terminated. You may not be able to
return
to the NETCOM prompt with the &quot;0&quot;'s thing. If so, just hangup the
modem
a7. We have now successfully setup and tested SLIRP.
a8. &quot;a8&quot; is for reference. You do not NEED any of &quot;a8&quot; for section
&quot;b&quot;.
Your PPP setings are:
IP Address = 10.0.2.15
Subnet Mask = 255.255.255.0
gateway = 192.100.81.254
host name = beh  (your login name, &quot;beh&quot; is mine)
domain name = netcom.com
dns servers = 199.182.120.203 199.182.120.202 (thanks to
netcruiser)
domain suffix = netcom.com
host IP = 10.0.2.2  (use telnet://10.0.2.2 for a local host
prompt)</p>
<pre><code>The next 3 items are very useful in setting up Netscape 2.0

NNTP server = 10.0.2.1  (news server)   
SMTP server = 10.0.2.2  (mail server) or smtp.ix.netcom.com
POP  server = 10.0.2.2  (post office)

and
select Properties.</li>

<li>Click OK twice</li>
</ol>
<p>Installing the Netscape World Wide Web browser
(Skip this if you already have a browser, i.e Plus Pack)</p>
<p>c1. Create sub-directory c:\\temp in Windows
c2. Copy ns16-100.exe to an empty directory
c3. &quot;Run&quot; ns16-100.exe
c4. &quot;Run&quot; setup.exe to install Netscape in the desired directory</p>
<p>Making it all work!</p>
<p>d1. Double-click the new Netcom Icon. You will be prompted for your
username and password.
d2. Click Connect
d3. Post Dial Terminal Screen should come up
d4. Login with your username and password
d5. At the Netcom prompt type &quot;ppp&quot; and enter
d6. After &quot;Slirp ready ...&quot; appears, click on &quot;continue&quot;
d7. Now click on the Netscape icon
d8. When your ready to exit NETCOM, close all of your winsock
applications (Netscape, Telnet, etc.) and disconnect</p>
<p>Problem solving and other stuff</p>
<p>e1. Windows 95 has a very good Telnet program in the Windows
directory. After setting it up with &quot;Options&quot; in Netscape.
Do telnet://10.0.2.2/ to get to a NETCOM prompt. Because we
started Slirp with the exec command, you should not receive
any &quot;multiple login&quot; nasty grams from NETCOM.
e2. Most pictures on the Web have a higher color resolution than
256 colors. Do My Computer -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Display -&gt;
Settings and select a color pallet with higher color resolution
for advanced video cards, such as 16 bit.
e3. If you get hard DNS lookup errors try this
http://198.95.249.77/  This is the same as
http://www.netscape.com/
If it works, look at your DNS server entries. Use the shell
command
&quot;ping -s&quot; for other IP addresses to test. Ping is in /usr/etc
e4. Netcom doesn't support Slirp. Check out
/ftp/pub/be/beh/policy.txt
You should post problems to netcom.shell.general,
netcom.shell.www,
alt.dcom.slip-emulators newsgroups or e-mail me at beh@netcom.com
e5. You just can't get Slirp to work. You click on the NETCOM icon,
&quot;Connect&quot;, do &quot;ppp&quot;, &quot;continue&quot;, and it just hangs. There may be
some
values in the &quot;master&quot; TCP/IP settings. Do My Computer -&gt; Control
Panel -&gt; Network -&gt; TCP/IP -&gt; Properties. There should be no
entries.
Everything should be &quot;Disable&quot;, &quot;none&quot;, or &quot;obtain automatically&quot;.
e6. If Auto Dial (Plus Pack only feature?) stops working, check that
url.dll hasn't been deleted from the windows\\system directory.
Sometimes when you un-install Netscape, it will delete this file.
e7. More goodies:</p>
<pre><code>My bookmark file on NETCOM (don't &amp;quot;ftp.netcom.com&amp;quot;, just &amp;quot;cd&amp;quot;)
/ftp/pub/be/beh/bookmark.html

My Windows 95 dial-up script on NETCOM (for the Plus Pack version)
/ftp/pub/be/beh/www/netcom.scp

Advanced scripting tool URL (same as Plus Pack)
http://www.microsoft.com/kb/softlib/mslfiles/dscrpt.exe

The latest Netscape software URL
(1.0 is old 16-bit, get the new 32-bit stuff, 2.0 is super)
http://www.netscape.com/

Real Audio URL (ABC, NPR, VOA are just waiting to be listened to)
Version 1.0 and 2.0 should work without modifing the .slirprc file
http://www.realaudio.com/

News Xpress URL (Great for decoding pictures)
ftp://ftp.hk.super.net/pub/windows95/wskutil/

CWS Apps List
http://cws.wilmington.net/

Text files on creating web pages, slirp binaries, I-phone, etc.

<p>Special thanks to seligman@netcom.com for writing the NNTP program
that
enables us to read NETCOM's news spool. This file is pointed to in the
.slirprc file and I have put a copy at /u2/beh/pub/nntpd</p>
<p>Last updated 03/15/96</p>
<p>Suggestions and corrections welcomed
beh@netcom.com</p>
<p>&lt;OTHER STUFF&gt;
cd
rm slirp
link -s /u1/nuglops/bin/slirp</p>
<p>To change your NNTPD link (so you can read the NETCOM news spool),
do the following at the NETCOM shell prompt</p>
<p>cd
pico .slirprc</p>
<p>Change the line that is     add exec /u2/beh/pub/nntpd:nntp
to                          add exec /u13/seligman/bin/nntpd:nntp</p>
<p>&lt;MORE OTHER STUFF&gt;</p>
<p>pub/be/beh/setup95.txt</p>
<p>a1. Login to NETCOMa2.</p>
