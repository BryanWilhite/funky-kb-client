<p>First, the documentation for all the XPath extension methods from LINQ to XML is already available online at http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.xml.xpath.extensions_methods(VS.90).aspx</p>
<p>Regarding the evaluation of XPath expressions returning XAttribute, you probably want to use XPathEvaluate() instead of XPathSelectElement<a href="">s</a>. XPathSelectElements() and XPathSelectElement() are specialized versions of XPathEvaluate() that return either a sequence of XElement or one XElement respectively. They are provided as properly typed convenience methods given that quering for elements is such a common task.</p>
