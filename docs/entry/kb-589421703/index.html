<p>I have decided to use fully qualified references to OLE Automation Libraries---even those considered &quot;default&quot; like the VB, VBA and Application objects. I do this because Microsoft says it does not hurt (it may improve performance slightly) and it allows me to take advantage of the &quot;Intelligent&quot; features of my IDEs. It is also an ongoing educational tool.</p>
<p>So in my Visual Basic 6.0 code, something like following will not be uncommon:</p>
<pre><code>If VBA.VarType(StartCol) &amp;lt;&amp;gt; vbLong Then
    VBA.Err.Raise 450
End If
</code></pre>
<p>By using fully qualified references, I can also see some of the &quot;mystery&quot; objects out there. For example, Debug is not a VBA object. And I thought for sure that the Open statement for file access was VBA method. But this does not seem to be the case.</p>
