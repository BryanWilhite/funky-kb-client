<section class="entry">

    <p>The physical operation on the genital organs of both sexes is regarded as a starting-point for various activities in the tribal organisation. It signifies that the individual operated upon has been given, during the course of the pre-initiation ceremonial dances and songs, all the essential information on the laws and customs of the tribe.</p>
<p>Among the things taught during this period are the matters relating to rules and regulations governing sexual indulgence. In order not to suppress entirely the normal sex instinct, the boys and girls are told that in order to keep good health they must acquire the technique of practising a certain restricted form of intercourse, called ombani na ngweko (platonic love and fondling). This form of intimate contact between young people is considered right and proper and the very foundation stone upon which to build a race morally, physically and mentally sound. For it safeguards the youth from nervous and psychic maladjustments.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Ngweko, or fondling, is looked upon as a sacred act and one which must be done in a systematic, well-organised manner. The Gikuyu do not kiss girls on the lips as Europeans do; therefore, ngweko takes the place of lip kissing, but, unlike Europeans, who are fond of kissing in public places, the Gikuyu consider such public display of affection vulgar. All matters relating to sex are done according to a well-regulated code of convention.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The tribal law prohibits a young man from pulling out a girl’s garment (kogucia mwengo wa moiretu) while having nqweko. He must put his sexual organ between his thighs so as to prevent touching the girl with it. The custom also prevents a girl from touching the male sexual organ with her hands. …Neither the man nor the girl can sleep with the back turned against the partner. The girl may not lie on top of the boy or across him…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The girl is expected to be a virgin in the sense of having an unperforated hymenal membrane when she marries. Any intercourse which may result in pregnancy before marriage is strictly forbidden.</p>
