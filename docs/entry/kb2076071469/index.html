<p>You know your code is running on an older, Windows NT, server when you see this error:</p>
<pre><code>Response object error 'ASP 0156 : 80004005 
Header Error...
The HTTP headers are already written to the client browser.
Any HTTP header modifications must be made before writing page content.
</code></pre>
<p>The implication is that your ASP page is rendering HTML before it encounters the Response.Redirect() method. Microsoft explains in detail why this is problematic in KB Article Q159402 (&quot;HOW TO: Use Response Redirect in a Server Script&quot;).</p>
<p>This problem is usually not encountered in Windows 2000 (and, I assume, versions above) as the Buffer property of the Response object is set to true in Windows 2000. To be very safe this form is suggested:</p>
<pre><code>&amp;lt;%
    Response.Buffer = True
    ...
%&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;HTML Rendering Here&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;%
    Response.Clear
    Response.Redirect &amp;quot;someother.asp&amp;quot;
%&amp;gt;
</code></pre>
