    <h3>Ousmane Sembène Interviews; Ulrich Gregor/1978; Sembène on the Nationalization of Film Distribution in Senegal; p. 109</h3>

<pre>
<p>My films aren’t shown since the cinemas are controlled by the national distribution company. No progress has been made here at all. We’ve got the structures, it was nationalized, but things are the same as ever, and the conditions imposed on the African cinema are actually more difficult since nationalisation than they were before. The control exercised by the bourgeoisie over film is even stronger than in colonial times.</p>
<p>[From <em>Framework</em>, no. 7/8 (1978)]</p>
