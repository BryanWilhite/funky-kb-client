    <h3>CRUCIFEROUS VEGETABLES</h3>

<pre>
<p>Did you know that cruciferous vegetables such as leafy-green vegetables, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, broccoli, and cabbage are crucial to reducing the chance of stroke by one third? Furthermore, citric fruits and juices have been found to have preventive measures against ischemic strokes. Ischemic strokes occur when a blood clot blocks the artery leading to the brain. They account for 80 percent of all strokes.</p>
<p>A 14-year study involving 75,596 women and 38,683 men found that five to six servings of cruciferous vegetables per day provided the maximum benefit against strokes. Consuming more than six servings per day had no greater impact on reducing the risk of strokes.</p>
