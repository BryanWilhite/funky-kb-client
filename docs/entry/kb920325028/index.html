<p>In the rare case of a hard core VB Progammer actually having respect for the W3C's recommendations and publications, such a person will want to avoid the CSS GUI editor provided by Visual Interdev 6.0.</p>
<p>It is useful to have the CSS files in InterDev Solutions open as text files by default. One way to do this is to set the Default under Open Withâ€¦ in the Project Explorer Window. For example:</p>
<pre><code>Choose Project &amp;gt; Add Item &amp;gt; New &amp;gt; StyleSheet
Choose View &amp;gt; Project Explorer
</code></pre>
<p>Visual InterDev may create a new CSS file named StyleSheet1.CSS. Right-click on the new CSS file.</p>
<pre><code>Choose Open With... &amp;gt; Source Code (Text) Editor
Click the Set as Default button
Click the Open button
</code></pre>
