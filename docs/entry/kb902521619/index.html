<p>When a report---say rptSales---is printed, the print dialog may show the user &quot;Now Printing 'rptSales' to LPT1&quot; if there is no caption property specified in the report.</p>
<p>The name rptSales is useful to the developer but not the user! Specify a more user-friendly name for the report by setting the Caption property of the report.</p>
