    <h3>Access to VB: The TabStrip Control in the Microsoft Windows Common Controls 6.0 Library</h3>

<pre>
<p>The TabStrip Control in the Microsoft Windows Common Controls 6.0 library (MSCOMCTL.OCX) is not as &quot;robust&quot; as the Tab Control native to Access. The greatest difference appears to be that the VB TabStrip Control is not a container. This means that at design time you cannot see your objects &quot;inside&quot; each tab. As of this writing, the VB developer must use Container Controls to group Controls on a &quot;page&quot; and the Visible property for the Container can be manipulated whenever a tab is clicked.</p>
<p>Now Microsoft does provide the Microsoft Tabbed Dialog Control (TABCTL32.OCX) and its design-time &quot;container&quot; features do match those of the the Access Tab control. But Container controls are still needed when you want to place a Control Array on a Tabbed Dialog page.</p>
