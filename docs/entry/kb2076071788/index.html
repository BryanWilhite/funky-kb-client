<pre>
<p>1.2.2 Servlets</p>
<p>HTTP requests to a Java Application server are handled by Servlets. Servlets provide &quot;an object-oriented view of the world that makes it easier to develop web applications.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A standard J2EE web application is, by definition, based on the Servlet API. Servlets run inside a container... The most popular servlet container is Tomcat...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sessions are one of the biggest benefits that the Servlet API provides... The Servlet API also provides lots of other goodies, like security, logging, life-cycle events, filters, packaging and deployment... all JSF applications are standard J2EE web applications.&quot;</p>
<p>1.2.3 Portlets</p>
<p>A portlet is the atomic unit of a Web portal. It is a region on a Web page that displays data from remote sources. This is similar to the Microsoft Web Part used in ASP.NET in general and SharePoint Server n particular. The portlet is defined by the Portlet API. It will not be discussed in detail in this book.</p>
