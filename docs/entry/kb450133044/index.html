<p>Access 97 online Help explains in detail the difference between Value and Text for data bound controls. This difference may be very important in the case of Combo Boxes where text displayed in the control is not the value stored in the bound column (ControlSource) of the control. It could also be used when the Input Mask Property is specified.</p>
<p>It seems not unreasonable to recall the OldValue Property of data-bound controls in this context. Remembering this property may be critical in a design manipuliating the Text property.</p>
<p>REMINDER: If txtBox is the name of a Text Box Control then</p>
<pre><code>txtBox.Value = txtBox
</code></pre>
<p>so the &quot;default value&quot; of the control is its Value property.</p>
