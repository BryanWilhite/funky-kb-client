            <h3>Research: Harris Papyrus</h3>
<section class="entry">

    <p>The Harris Papyrus</p>
<p>I am thy first sister
And thou art to me as the garden
Which I have planted with flowers
And all sweet-smelling herbs
I directed a canal into it
That thou mightest dip thy hand into it
When the north wind blows cool
The beautiful place where we take a walk
When thy hand rests within mine
With thoughtful mind and joyous heart
Because we walk together
It is intoxicating to me to hear thy voice
And my life depends upon hearing thee whenever I see thee
It is better to me than food or drink</p>
<p>The Beautiful Joyous Songs
of Thy Sister Whom Thy Heart Loves
Who Walks in the Fields</p>
<p>The love of my beloved leaps on the bank of the stream
A crocodile lies in the shadows
Yet
I go down into the water and breast the wave
My courage is high on the stream
And the water is as land to my feet
It is her love that makes me strong
She is a book of spells to me
When I behold my beloved coming my heart is glad
My arms are spread apart to embrace her
My heart rejoices forever...since my beloved came
When I embrace her I am as one who is in Incense Land
As one who carries perfumes
When I kiss her, her lips are opened and I am merry without beer
Would that I were her servant who is in attendance on her
So should I behold the hue of all her limbs</p>
