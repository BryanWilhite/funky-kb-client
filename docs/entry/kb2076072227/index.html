<p>Blankman: Since a WCF service can return any user defined class, why use a DataContract and CompositeType class?</p>
<p>I can return something like:</p>
<p>[OperationContract]
MyUserCollection GetUsers();</p>
<p>What am I missing?</p>
<p>Guy Starbuck: The DataContract is just a formal definition of a type that can be understood on both sides of the service boundary.</p>
<p>If you return, as in your example, a &quot;MyUserCollection&quot; object, the consumers of your service will need to reference the innards of your service/system, which is a violation of the SOA tenet of explicit boundaries. By using a DataContract, you are publishing the structure of your return types in a loosely-coupled way.</p>
