<p>The following code fragment demonstrates how the FreeFile function searches for a free file number when opening a file:</p>
<p>Dim i As Integer
i = FreeFile
Open &lt;file&gt; For Input As #i
Do Until EOF(i)
&lt;stuff&gt;
Loop
Close #i</p>
<p>Use this technique when there is uncertainty about about the file numbers in use.</p>
