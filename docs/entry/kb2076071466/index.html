    <h3>Songhay3: MSI K7T Turbo-R; System Unit Powers Up Unexpectedly</h3>

<pre>
<p>When the BIOS setting under Power Management Setup called &quot;State After Power Failure&quot; is not set to Off the system unit may power up unexpectedly and immediately power off. The assumption here is that the system unit expects to be connected to a continuous power source (even when shut off) instead of a power strip that is turned on and off.</p>
