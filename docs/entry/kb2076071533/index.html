<p>Don Box loves XPathNavigator because it is based on XPath (http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath) instead of an XML data model.</p>
<p>Don very articulately and humanely explores XPathNavigator in &quot;Passing XML Data Inside the CLR&quot; on MSDN TV at:</p>
<pre><code>http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdntv/episode.aspx
    ?xml=episodes/en/20030603XMLDB/manifest.xml
</code></pre>
<p>He goes on to explain that instances of XPathNavigator comes from XPathDocument. This is important to me because XPathDocument objects can be passed to Transform() method of an instance of XslTransform.</p>
