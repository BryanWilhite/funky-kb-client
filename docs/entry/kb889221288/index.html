    <h3>Using Queries to Handle Replication Errors</h3>

<pre>
<p>All replication synchronization data errors are stored in a hidden system table called MSysErrors. It has column (or field name) called RowGUID that can be used in joins with the table generating the error.</p>
<p>The join between the MSysErrors and the table in question is between the fields RowGUID and s_GUID respectively. This information can be used to build temporary queries in the QDE.</p>
<p>Recall that in order to see system tables like MSysErrors select Tools &gt; Options &gt; Show &gt; System Objects from the Menu Bar.</p>
