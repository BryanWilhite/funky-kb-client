<p>A general overview (with some specific advice) is &quot;How to use the Settings class in C#&quot; by Seun found here:</p>
<pre><code>http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/PropertiesSettings.asp
</code></pre>
<p>User-scope settings are saved in the Local Settings folder:</p>
<pre><code>%UserProfile%&amp;bsol;&amp;bsol;Local Settings&amp;bsol;&amp;bsol;Application Data&amp;bsol;&amp;bsol;[Company]&amp;bsol;&amp;bsol;
</code></pre>
<p>where [Company] is specified under Properties &gt; Application &gt; Assembly Information...</p>
<p>The Settings.Default.SettingsLoaded event will not fire until a setting is called.</p>
<p>The Settings.Default.Upgrade() method must be called in order to obtain previously saved settings. You can call this method when there are no previously saved settings without an exception penalty.</p>
