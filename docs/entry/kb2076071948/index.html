<p>Contiguous—side by side, in close proximity.</p>
<p>Height, Height of Tone—the lightness or darkness of colors. Yellow and pink are colors of high tone, while violet and olive are colors of low tone.</p>
<p>Intensity—a term commonly used by Chevreul in a rather loose way to indicate purity or brightness in color.</p>
<p>Luminous Colors—red, orange, yellow, bright green.</p>
<p>Mixed Contrast—the influence of afterimages on other colors. Also the visual mixture or diffusion of colors on the retina of the eye.</p>
<p>Primary Colors—red, yellow, blue.</p>

<p>Ternary—groups of three colors.</p>
<p>Tertiary Colors—grayed colors, such as russet, citrine, olive, (Usually, the colors that result from mixtures of secondaries, orange, green violet.)</p>
