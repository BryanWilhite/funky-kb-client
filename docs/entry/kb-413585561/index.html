    <p>GOING FOR 400 HELPS WEIGHT LOSS STICK</p>
<p>Individuals who are most successful at long-term weight loss burn an average of 400 calories per day through exercise in addition to keeping their caloric intake in check, says the National Weight Control Registry (NWCR).</p>
<p>According to the scientists who maintain the registry, walking is the most popular form of exercise among the more than 2,000 successful &quot;losers&quot; being tracked. Since most individuals burn about 100 calories per mile walked, these folks are hoofing it about four miles per day.</p>
<p>The former heavyweights being tracked by the NWCR are no dieting lightweights. To qualify for the registry, individuals must have lost a minimum of 30 pounds and kept it off for at least a year. But according to the registry researchers, the average &quot;loser&quot; on the registry has shed 60 pounds and kept it off for five years.</p>
<p>So, no more excuses that you don't have time for the gym. Slap on those shoes and start walking!</p>
