<p>Turning Off AutoCorrect Per Field</p>
<p>AutoCorrect can hurt more than it can help in Access forms. To turn it off at the application level (via Options... &gt; Spelling) may not be the way to go as this could affect other Office applications---not to mention the preferences of your users.</p>
<p>Data Validation against ADP Forms</p>
<p>We should use the Other &gt; Allow AutoCorrect property in the Properties dialog. This allows us to turn off AutoCorrect on a per-field basis.</p>
<p>After the data is entered into an ADP form, we should use T-SQL style expressions in the Data &gt; Validation Rule property in the Properties... dialog. For example, to require a file name with an extension entered into a Text Box we have:</p>
<pre><code>ALike '%_._%' Or Is Null
</code></pre>
<p>where I am still trying to figure out what &quot;ALike&quot; means. In any canse, we can see T-SQL-like syntax for LIKE expressions.</p>
