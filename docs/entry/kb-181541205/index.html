    <h3>PERSONAL SELF-CONTROL</h3>

<pre>
<p>People who are successful in their exercise programs are generally highly committed to their programs. They have developed a psychological hardiness that helps them to meet challenges that might have pushed other people to the sidelines. One of the keys to this type of self-motivation is the concept of internal locus of control.</p>
<p>People with an internal locus of control believe the rewards of life are the results of their own actions, not some external force beyond their control. Because of this belief, they become passionate about obtaining their fitness goals. They seek out challenges and see change as opportunity, not as a threat. They take credit for their successes.</p>
<p>Achieving our fitness goals requires us to become self-directed individuals. We must individualize our fitness program to meet our needs and abilities. We must choose to be in charge of our fitness and not a victim of our own whims. We cannot see fitness as a matter of luck or chance but as a result of our own actions. The process of self-motivation begins and continues with each exercise session. We are our own number-one fans.</p>
