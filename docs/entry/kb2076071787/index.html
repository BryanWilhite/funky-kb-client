<p>RAD tools have four layers: (i) an underlying component architecture, (ii) a set of standard widgets, (iii) and application infrastructure, (iv) the tool itself.</p>
<p>JavaServer Faces (JSF or Faces) defines three of the four layers of RAD tools, leaving &quot;the tool itself&quot; to be the NetBeans or Eclipse IDE.</p>
<p>&quot;Faces can also automatically keep your UI components in sync with Java objects that collect user input values and respond to events, which are called backing beans.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;JSF runs on the server. As such, a Faces application will run in a standard Java web container like Apache Tomcat [ASF, Tomcat]...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;JavaServer Faces was introduced as Java Specification Request (JSR) 127 by Sun in May 2001...and JSF 1.1 (a maintenance release) arrived on May 27th, 2004.&quot;</p>
