            <h3>Visual InterDev and Seagate Crystal Reports: Notes on Data Definition Files and the Convert Database Driver... Command</h3>
<section class="entry">

    <p>Crystal Web Reporting services have proven themselves to be somewhat &quot;ok&quot; in my Visual InterDev Solutions. My design uses an MTS package that provides data services to pass recordsets to Crystal Report objects. These objects are passed via very expensive (but required) Session-level object variables to the Viewer. (I am using Crystal's Java viewer by the way: it runs very slow on Netscape 4.x but &quot;mysteriously&quot; fast in IE 4.x.)</p>
<p>The Crystal *.RPT files must be prepared for this kind of service. These *.RPT files are made &quot;server independent&quot; with the use of Data Definition Files (.TTX files). Since I am working in a team environment on machines with different versions of Crystal Reports, I built a tool called the Crystal DDF Utility that can make .TTX files without running the Designer application. All this utility needs is database logon information a .TTX file to write to and SQL to generate a Recordset. You can find this utility in a self-extracting .CAB file at:</p>
<p>http://www.kintespace.com/kb/util/CrystDDF/CrystDDF.EXE</p>
<p>After the .TTX file is created, we need to prepare the .RPT file. Here is a summary of the steps involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make sure File &gt; Save Data with Report is disabled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verify that there are no database server references under Location in the Set Location dialog (Database &gt; Set Location...).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select Database &gt; Convert Database Driver...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select Convert Database Driver on next Refresh.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select To: &gt; pdsmon.dll [ADO, RDO, DAO]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the Select Data Source dialog appears, select Data Definition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter the .TTX file you created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Answer yes to &quot;Fix Up&quot; the report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save and Close.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>WARNING: There is a bug involved with the Select Data Source dialog. It seems to only run once per 32-bit designer session. You may have to close and open the Designer application several times to prepare several reports.</p>
