    <h3>VEGETARIAN DIET-MISSING LINKS     </h3>

<pre>
<p>With careful planning, you can follow a vegetarian diet that provides all the vitamins, minerals, calories, and protein your body needs. If you don't carefully plan your meals, you can compromise some nutrients.</p>
<p>Listed below are the nutrients that are more likely to be at risk in vegetarian diets, along with the sources for obtaining these nutrients:</p>
<p>Iron (delivers oxygen throughout the body)---found in fish and poultry, but also in dark, leafy green vegetables, whole grains, and soy products</p>
<p>Zinc (needed for growth/repair of tissues)---found in fish and poultry, nuts and seeds, hard cheeses, whole grains, and soy products</p>
<p>Calcium (needed for healthy bones and teeth)---found in milk, cheese, broccoli, almonds, legumes, and soy products</p>
<p>Vitamin D (needed for healthy bones)---found in milk. With adequate sun exposure, the body can produce its own vitamin D.</p>
<p>Vitamin B12 (needed for cell growth)---found in milk products and eggs. For strict vegetarians, this nutrient must be supplemented.</p>
