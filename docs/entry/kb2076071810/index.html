<p>1.3 Persistence layers and alternatives</p>
<p>&quot;A layered architecture defines interfaces between code that implements the various concerns, allowing a change to the way one concern is implemented without significant disruption to code in the other layers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Layers communicate top to bottom. A layer is dependent only on the layer
directly below it... Each layer is unaware of any other layers except for the layer just below it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Different applications group concerns differently, so they define different layers. A typical, proven, high-level application architecture uses three layers, one each for presentation, business logic, and persistence...&quot; In addition to these layers, there are the Database and Helper/Utility classes.</p>
<p>About four implementation options are listed for the persistence layer: Hand-coding a persistence layer with SQL/JDBC, serialization, EJB entity beans, object-oriented database systems and a snub for XML persistence.</p>
