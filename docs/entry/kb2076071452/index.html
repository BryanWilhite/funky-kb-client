<p>To remove projects from your Most Recently Used list (and from the VS.NET Start Page) remove keys or edit values under the following key:</p>
<pre><code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER&amp;bsol;&amp;bsol;Software&amp;bsol;&amp;bsol;Microsoft&amp;bsol;&amp;bsol;VisualStudio&amp;bsol;&amp;bsol;7.0&amp;bsol;&amp;bsol;ProjectMRUList
</code></pre>
