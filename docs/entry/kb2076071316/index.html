    <h3>Flippant Remarks about EQ</h3>

<pre>
<p>First of all for expert remarks about equalization see http://www.prorec.com/ where a search for Lionel Dumond finds some articles back in 1998 that are informative. I can only write very basic things like:</p>
<p>EQ is the most important digital effects tool the desktop audio engineer has.</p>
<p>Each instrument in a perfect mix should occupy their own band in the frequency spectrum.</p>
<p>No sound has one frequency. It is a mixture of frequencies. Almost all sounds contain &quot;bass&quot; frequencies ( &lt; 200Hz) because (I assume) they don't require that much energy to generate.</p>
<p>Most of my poorly EQ'd mixes suffer from &quot;bass build-up&quot; that sounds dull or &quot;blurry.&quot; High frequencies (used properly) give me the feeling of brightness and focus.</p>
<p>I can begin to identify sounds (like a good sound engineer) in terms of its frequency by looking at the five bands of my car stereo equalizer:</p>
<p>Deep bass is around 60Hz; bass is around 250Hz; the &quot;middle&quot; (where I think most of the annoying noise can be) is around 1000Hz; &quot;treble&quot; sounds begin at 3.5KHz; and the brightest stuff is about 10KHz.</p>
