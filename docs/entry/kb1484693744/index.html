    <h3>OUTSMART THE MOSQUITOES</h3>

<pre>
<p>By Brigitte Mars, for healthshop.com</p>
<p>If you are going to be out amongst the mosquitoes this summer, there are some ways to appear less tasty to them. Taking garlic capsules leaves a chemical residue that mosquitoes don't like in the pores of your skin. Also, ingesting a vitamin B complex (containing 100 mg of vitamin B1) causes the body to produce an odor that is not detectable to humans but is disliked by mosquitoes. There are also essential oil blends, including essential oils of citronella, lavender, eucalyptus, and geranium, that can be applied to the body as nontoxic insect repellents.</p>
