<ul>
<li>
<p>Determine the time signature of the loop. It is customarily 4/4. The musician that created the loop should provide this information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine the key of the loop. The musician that created the loop should provide this information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine the tempo of the loop. The musician that created the loop should provide this information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Listening to the loop sample, count the number of beats in the loop using the time signature. (This takes rhythm folks!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select Edit ACID Properties &gt; Loop. In the Root note for transposing: field, enter the key of the loop. In the Number of beats (...): field, enter the number of beats counted. Click on OK.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select Edit Tempo. The number in the Tempo in beats per minute: field should already contain a value that is close to the value provided by the musician that created the loop. Click on OK. If you are viewing the sample in the Measures &amp; Beats status format, then the tick marks should update to reflect the new tempo.</p>
</li>
</ul>
