    <h3>Flippant Remarks about Digital Cameras</h3>

<pre>
<p>My most annoying incorrect assumption about digital cameras is that they are devices for people who do not want to deal with a DV Camera. Then I learned that most DV Cameras produce still images no larger than the NTSC dimensions (e.g. 720 x 576). The entry-level cameras that Computer User mentions in its May 2002 article, &quot;Digicams for the rest of us,&quot; have resolutions like 1600 x 1200 (Canon's PowerShot S110 Digital Elph) which is quite suitable for the printed page.</p>
<p>According to Computer User, &quot;Digital cameras fall into three major categories: point-and-shoot, field cameras, and studio cameras or backs...&quot; where the first group is the digital equivalent of the 35mm camera (like Canon's PowerShot S110 Digital Elph) and the other groups are not worth mentioning at the moment as they are too expensive for me.
When evaluating a digital camera Computer User suggests that, &quot;There are three major factors to consider when shopping for a digicam.&quot; They have optics (lenses and &quot;megapixels&quot; [2.3 or greater]), the imaging chip (CMOS or CCD) and image compression quality (usually JPEG).</p>
