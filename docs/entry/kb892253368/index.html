<p>To promote scalability and portability of custom code within the VBA/VB world, Access macros should be replaced by code modules whenever possible. Macros can be replaced by code modules except in the following cases:</p>
<p>An AutoExec macro can be used when the database is first opened. Much of the use of such a macro as been replaced by the Tools &gt; Startup... command.</p>
<p>An AutoKeys macro can create custom key combinations.</p>
<p>When Access is used as a DDE server, macros are neeeded.</p>
<p>When a user-defined procedure is called from a toolbar, a macro must be called.</p>
<p>A RunCode macro can be used to call VBA routines. The macro allows storing a user-defined procedure in a variable.</p>
