    <h3>BENEFITS OF TEA TREE OIL</h3>

<pre>
<p>By Brigitte Mars, for healthshop.com</p>
<p>Tea tree oil's antibacterial properties have been documented by researchers since the 1920s. It was a standard ingredient in Australian first aid kits until World War II. At home, tea tree oil can be applied to disinfect cuts, pimples, and fungal infections.</p>
<p>Gargling with two drops in a glass of warm water improves sore throats and a few drops rubbed on the chest or back helps relieve nasal congestion. It is one of the few essential oils that can be applied directly to the skin without dilution.</p>
