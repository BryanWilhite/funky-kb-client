<p>The following message may require a look at the Registry:</p>
<pre><code>'ipconfig' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
</code></pre>
<p>Look at these three keys:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM
\\CURRENTCONTROLSET\\CONTROL
\\SESSION MANAGER\\ENVIRONMENT
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM
\\CONTROLSET001\\CONTROL
\\SESSION MANAGER\\ENVIRONMENT
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM
\\CONTROLSET002\\CONTROL
\\SESSION MANAGER\\ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>If the Path value under any of these keys is of type STRING then the environment variable %SystemRoot% cannot &quot;expand&quot; to resolve to the &quot;real&quot; path where your system files are. It follows that ipconfig cannot be recognized by the system.</p>
<p>To resolve this problem replace the Path environment variable under:</p>
<pre><code>System Properties &amp;gt; Advanced &amp;gt; Environment Variables &amp;gt; System Variables
</code></pre>
<p>where the System Properties dialog can be found by right-clicking on the My Computer icon on the Desktop and selecting Properties. For more detailed instructions refer to MS KB article Q317206 (&quot;MMS Lotus Notes Plug-In Alters the Windows Path Environment&quot;).</p>
