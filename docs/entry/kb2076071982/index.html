<p>Consider three files each containing one word:</p>
<pre><code>1.txt
2.txt
3.txt
</code></pre>
<p>This cat command, cat *.txt, produces the following output:</p>
<pre><code>One
Two
Three
</code></pre>
<p>where each word is the one word in the three text files, respectively. Now we need to store this concatenated output in a compressed gzip file:</p>
<pre><code> cat *.txt | gzip &amp;gt; out.txt.gz
</code></pre>
<p>This piping is redirected into a *.gz file that contains one file, out.txt. The assumption here today is that this procedure can be used for apache log files generated by, say, vlogger.</p>
