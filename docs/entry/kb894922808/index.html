    <h3>Book: Level 2: Programming Visual Basic 5.0; Chapter 15 Highlights (2/2): An Introduction to Objects</h3>

<pre>
<p>The Difference between Simple Variables and Object Variables</p>
<p>Simple variables actually store the data they represent. Object variables always store a reference to the physical location of the data. This difference can be seen in the use of the Set keyword when assigning values to object variables:</p>
<pre><code>Set m_frmComboBox = frmTest.cboStates
</code></pre>
<p>We cannot use this object variable without declaring it. The declaration is of the form:</p>
<p>Private m_frmComboBox As ComboBox</p>
<p>Visual Basic Object Types</p>
<p>Object hierarchy for forms:
Object &gt; Form &gt; &lt;user-defined class name of form&gt;</p>
<p>Object hierarchy for controls:
Object &gt; Control &gt; TextBox | List Box | Combo Box</p>
<p>Both specific object types, Form and Control, descend from the generic Object. The use of Object causes VB to implement &quot;late binding&quot; during compilation. The use of specific object types promotes &quot;early binding&quot; (and faster code). For more details please see page 15-21.</p>
<p>Referring to Objects on Forms</p>
<p>Here are three ways to refer to the combo box, cboStates, on the form frmTest:</p>
<p>frmTest.cboStates 'dot syntax
frmTest!cboStates 'bang syntax
frmTest(&quot;cboStates&quot;) 'collection object syntax</p>
<p>There is actually an advantage in using the bang syntax. For more details please see page 15-19.</p>
<p>The Concept of Collections</p>
<p>Collections are similar to arrays. Collections are superior to arrays in many ways. Collections can have unique string names as well as the numerical index used in arrays.</p>
<p>Iterating through the Members of a Collection</p>
<p>Use the For Each...Next structure. There is no need to determine the number of elements in the collection.</p>
