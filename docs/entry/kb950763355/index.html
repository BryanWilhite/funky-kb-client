    <h3>TODAY'S TIP: THE LATE-NIGHT SNACK</h3>

<pre>
<p>By Lindsay Edwards</p>
<p>Eating late is a common pattern among people with busy daily schedules. Many people eat light during the day and then eat their main meal at night when they get home from work. However, going to ed with a full stomach is not beneficial for digestion or sleep.</p>
<p>Food often acts as a sedative, providing a feeling of relaxation. That's why many consider a bedtime snack a necessary part of their
nighttime routine. Unfortunately, when you go to bed with a full stomach, the food consumed simply lies undigested in your stomach. Not only does this behavior contribute to weight gain, it also causes you to wake up the next morning feeling full and sluggish. Eating late can become a habit that robs you of your vitality.</p>
<p>To aid in digestion, and to help you sleep at bedtime, try these helpful hints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eat earlier in the evening, ideally before dark.</li>
<li>Eat foods in smaller quantities.</li>
<li>Engage in some activity, both mental and physical, before going to bed.</li>
</ul>
