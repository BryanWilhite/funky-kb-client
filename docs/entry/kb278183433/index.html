<p>Javascript talks to Java Applets by calling the public methods of the Applet and changing its public properties. Java talks to Javascript using third-party interfaces from Microsoft (stuff in VJ++ 6.x) and Netscape (special java packages). I am not aware of any standard way for a Java applet to access the object model of a browser.</p>
