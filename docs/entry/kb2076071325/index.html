    <h3>THE EYE IS ON THE POTATO</h3>

<pre>
<p>Potatoes are among the most popular vegetables in America. In fact, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that the average American eats approximately 138 pounds of potatoes every year!</p>
<p>Many people say that the skin of the potato contains most of the nutrients. This isn't entirely true. While the skin is a good source of fiber and vitamin C--containing about 20 percent of the recommended daily allowances for these nutrients--the majority of the potato's nutrients are found in the pulp. You can almost double your intake of most nutrients when you eat both the pulp and the skin of a potato.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of interesting facts about potatoes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Thomas Jefferson introduced French fries when he served them at the White House.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are more than 5,000 varieties of potatoes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
