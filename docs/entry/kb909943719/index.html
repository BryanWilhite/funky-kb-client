    <h3>PROBLEM: When a DoCmd Action is Called from Code but Cancelled By the User a Runtime Error Occurs; Error 2501</h3>

<pre>
<p>When a DoCmd Action is called from VBA code but cancelled by user a runtime error occurs. This is error 2501. I usually trap this VBA.Err and Resume to the exit line label in my error handling structure.</p>
