<section class="entry">

    <p>Chapter 4: Utilities Group</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This chapter makes it clear that a completely visual interface makes it difficult to locate tools described with words in the manual. I had a very difficult time locating the Add Regular Polygon tool and the Convert NURBS Patch to polyhedron (or curve to Polygon) tool. I recommend creating a custom configuration for the Configuration Library using the tool repository under the Recycle Bin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Polygon Reduction Tool creates new objects in the same location as the original. So move the new object to see it after it is created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Polygon Reduction Tool works with Level of Detail groups (LOD groups) used in VRML.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I had to add the Move, Spin and Scale Magnetic Object tools to my custom configuration as they were not found in any of the default configurations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Chapter 5: Primitives</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A straightforward read.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the Help Bar and mouse hovering over the various parts of the Magic Ring to be reminded of its functions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Chapter 6: Selection and Polygon Edit</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Paint several polygon faces simultaneously by clicking on Paint Face tool in the Material Editor while the faces are selected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Named selections are stored with the object and scene so you can come back and
use these selections throughout multiple sessions.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The section entitled &quot;Selecting Multiple Objects&quot; assumes that you are using the Object Tool. This implies that &quot;rectangle select&quot; and &quot;lasso select&quot; do not refer to the polygon face selection tools in section 6.2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;You have the option to animate almost all Point Edit functions in trueSpace5... Note that vertex-level animation is incompatible with the DynDiv functions.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Polygon Copy and Polygon Draw tools can create areas on a face that can be textured or extruded apart from the face on which it was drawn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Polygon Slice Tool can work in concert with the Slice by Selected Line/Plane Tool to create a plane for slices. These tools in turn work with the Separate tool to completely remove a sliced section of an object making a new object.</p>
</li>
</ul>
