<p>Your friendly hosting service may have Safe Mode enabled for PHP. Safe Mode is described here:</p>
<pre><code>http://us2.php.net/features.safe-mode
</code></pre>
<p>This means that you are not able to test for the existence of a file or directory with a root different from the “allowed path(s).” One way around this problem is to re-factor your PHP code to test for the allowed path(s) when possible.</p>
