<p>Have you been down the drink aisle at your local grocery and seen all the different types of bottled waters that are available? Since 1985, bottled-water sales have nearly doubled, making water the fastest growing part of the beverage market. The hype on drinking bottled water originated because many people simply dislike the taste of tap water, and some people need to limit their intake of the minerals found in traditional tap water.</p>
<p>The list below will help you differentiate between all the possible bottled-water options:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Distilled water: water that has been evaporated and then condensed, leaving it mineral free</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Purified or distilled water: water whose minerals have been removed either by deionization or by reverse osmosis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spring water: water collected from an underground location (a natural spring)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mineral water: water that contains no less than 250 parts per million of naturally occurring solids or minerals. The water can be labeled as either low- or high-mineral content.</p>
</li>
</ul>
