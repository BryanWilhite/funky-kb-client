<p>To disable the speaker emulation for virtual machines, add the following line to Workstation's global configuration file:</p>
<p>mks.noBeep = &quot;TRUE&quot;</p>
<p>The global configuration file should exist in ~/.vmware/config on a Linux host, and \\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\Application Data\\VMware\\VMware Workstation\\config.ini on a Windows host.</p>
<p>If the file does not exist, create a new text file and add the mks.noBeep line to it. Also see &quot;Creating and Editing config.ini&quot; (for Windows hosts) at http://kb.vmware.com/kb/1754.</p>
