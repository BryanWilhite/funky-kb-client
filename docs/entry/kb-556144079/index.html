<p>Borrowing heavily from the writings of Microsoft, please consider TableA and TableB with ColumnA and ColumnB respectively. Here are the two outer joins in a WHERE clause:</p>
<pre><code>TableA.ColumnA *= TableB.ColumnB
</code></pre>
<p>This means, &quot;Show all values in ColumnA but only the values in ColumnB where they are equal to those in ColumnA.&quot;</p>
<pre><code>TableA.ColumnA =* TableB.ColumnB
</code></pre>
<p>This means, &quot;Show all values in ColumnB but only the values in ColumnA where they are equal to those in ColumnB.&quot;</p>
<p>An Outer Join cannot be used in the same SQL statement with an Equijoin. The prescence of Null values in columns used in an outer join produces unexpected results.</p>
