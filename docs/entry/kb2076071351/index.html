    <h3>HOW TO USE SOY</h3>

<pre>
<p>Studies suggest that eating soy foods regularly can prevent serious
diseases like breast, colon, and prostate cancer, heart disease, and
osteoporosis. Soy has long been known as a healthy food. It's an
excellent source of fiber and is low in saturated fat. Soy can be a
healthy addition to any diet or a substitute for meat.</p>
<p>By adding one serving of soy foods to your diet, you start reaping all
the benefits soy has to offer. Following are some easy ways to get soy
into your diet:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Soy milk: use in cereal, shakes, baked goods, or pancakes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tofu: use as a sour cream substitute in salad dressings or dips.
You can also use tofu in soups and salads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Soy flour: use in baking, but if you need something to rise, mix
the soy flour with wheat flour.</p>
</li>
</ul>
