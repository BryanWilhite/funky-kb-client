    <h3>JavaScript: “JavaScript OPERATORS: = (Assignment Operators)”; DevGuru.com</h3>

<pre>
<p>OPERATORS: =
The basic assignment operator is the equal sign, which assigns the value (literal or variable) on its right to the variable on its left:</p>
<p>Code:
x = a;</p>
<p>The assignment operator can also be combined with a variety of other operators to provide shorthand versions of standard operations. It combines with the arithmetic operators +, -, *, / and % to give the following shorthand versions:</p>
<p>a += b instead of a = a + b
a -= b instead of a = a - b
a *= b instead of a = a * b
a /= b instead of a = a / b
a %= b instead of a = a % b</p>
<p>It also combines with the following bitwise operators:</p>
<p>a &lt;&lt;= b instead of a = a &lt;&lt; b
a &gt;&gt;= b instead of a = a &gt;&gt; b
a &gt;&gt;&gt;= b instead of a = a &gt;&gt;&gt; b
a &amp;= b instead of a = a &amp; b
a ^= b instead of a = a ^ b
a |= b instead of a = a | b</p>
