    <h3>PHP: A Few “Magical” Constants</h3>

<pre>
<p><strong>LINE</strong>
The current line number of the file.</p>
<p><strong>FILE</strong>
The full path and filename of the file. If used inside an include, the name of the included file is returned. Since PHP 4.0.2, <strong>FILE</strong> always contains an absolute path with symlinks resolved whereas in older versions it contained relative path under some circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>DIR</strong>
The directory of the file. If used inside an include, the directory of the included file is returned. This is equivalent to dirname(<strong>FILE</strong>). This directory name does not have a trailing slash unless it is the root directory. (Added in PHP 5.3.0.)</p>
<p><strong>FUNCTION</strong>
The function name. (Added in PHP 4.3.0) As of PHP 5 this constant returns the function name as it was declared (case-sensitive). In PHP 4 its value is always lowercased.</p>
<p><strong>CLASS</strong>
The class name. (Added in PHP 4.3.0) As of PHP 5 this constant returns the class name as it was declared (case-sensitive). In PHP 4 its value is always lowercased.</p>
<p><strong>METHOD</strong>
The class method name. (Added in PHP 5.0.0) The method name is returned as it was declared (case-sensitive).</p>
<p><strong>NAMESPACE</strong>
The name of the current namespace (case-sensitive). This constant is defined in compile-time (Added in PHP 5.3.0).</p>
