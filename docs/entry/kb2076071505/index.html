<p>Searching for text with Regular Expressions should be straight forward. I constantly read this reference at design-time:</p>
<pre><code>ms-help://MS.VSCC/MS.MSDNVS/vsintro7/html/vxgrfregularexpressionss.htm
</code></pre>
<p>What was elusive to me was how to replace what I found using the Replace All command. This is done by &quot;tagging&quot; expressions with brackets {}. So the following regular expression will look for HTML numerical attributes without XHTML-friendly quotes:</p>
<pre><code>&amp;bsol;&amp;bsol;=[0-9]+
</code></pre>
<p>But this expression will not let me insert quotes after the equal sign. This expression will:</p>
<pre><code>{&amp;bsol;&amp;bsol;=}{[0-9]+}
</code></pre>
<p>This expression works just like the previous one. All we have now are two tagged sub-expressions that can be located with the \\n syntax. The corresponding replace expression is therefore:</p>
<pre><code>&amp;bsol;&amp;bsol;1&amp;quot;&amp;bsol;&amp;bsol;2&amp;quot;
</code></pre>
<p>This says, &quot;Insert a quote after the first set of tagged text characters and another quote after the second set of tagged text characters.&quot;</p>
