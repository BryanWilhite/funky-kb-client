<p>Allocating 48MB of RAM for an Ubuntu Server VM running a LAMP image is reasonable. 96MB seems more than enough for a single-user development environment. The VM hard drive image should be about 1GB.</p>
<p>The foremost issue is getting the console display to appear correctly in Virtual PC 2004. Edit /boot/grub/menu.lst to change the first entry in the list of Automagic Kernels such that:</p>
<pre><code>kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.10-5-386 root=/dev/hda1 ro quiet splash
</code></pre>
<p>becomes</p>
<pre><code>kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.10-5-386 root=/dev/hda1 ro quiet splash vga=0x314
</code></pre>
<p>You can also hit ESC during the GRUB boot sequence and set vga=0x314.</p>
<p>Install hung at times. It was probably looking for updates on the network but the virtual networking was not working. This command made ping work as expected:</p>
<pre><code>sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.254.33
</code></pre>
<p>The IP address in the example above, 192.168.254.33, should be entered in the Windows HOSTS file for machine/netbios name resolution. Edit the HOSTS file here:</p>
<pre><code>%SystemRoot%&amp;bsol;&amp;bsol;System32&amp;bsol;&amp;bsol;DRIVERS&amp;bsol;&amp;bsol;ETC&amp;bsol;&amp;bsol;HOSTS
</code></pre>
<p>To install new software, the recommendation here is to use APT. See &quot;Package management with apt&quot; here:</p>

<p>This was useful for understanding, say, how accessing a CD-ROM drive works in Linux.</p>
