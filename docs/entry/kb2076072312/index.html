    <h3>“When to use RenderAction vs RenderPartial with ASP.NET MVC”</h3>

<pre>
<p>At first glance, RenderAction and RenderPartial both do a very similar thing – they load ‘some other content’ into the view being rendered at the place they are called. Personally, I think they should be used for different scenarios so these are my thoughts on where each one should be used and why.</p>
<p>First though, a quick recap on what they do:</p>
<pre><code>* RenderPartial renders a control with some model passed to it.
* RenderAction (or RenderSubAction which addresses some issues) calls a controller action and then renders whatever view that returns with whatever model that controller action passes through it.
</code></pre>
<p>Hmmn, they sound pretty similar don’t they! The thing to note though is that the model passed to RenderPartial is either the current model being rendered by the calling view or a subset of it. Anything that a RenderPartial view being called is going to need has to be passed into the Model of the calling view. The view rendered using RenderAction on the other hand could contain a completely different model with no need for this to be passed in to our parent view.</p>
<p>Because of this, I think RenderPartial is most appropriate when what it is going to output could be considered part of the calling view but separating it out into a user control makes sense to allow re-use and avoid repeating the same rendering code in multiple views.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>So that is where and how I think RenderPartial should be used. How about RenderAction?</p>
<p>Well, I think this has it’s place when the thing that needs to be rendered isn’t the responsibility of the calling view or controller.</p>
<p>For example, I may have a PersonController responsible for CRUD operations on the Person class including a Display action and view but I do not want either of these to have any responsibility for anything to do with the display of Projects that the person is working on. If I want to display a list of assigned projects within the Person Display view then I would use RenderAction to add it but the responsibility and knowledge of how to do this resides with the ProjectController and it’s views.</p>
