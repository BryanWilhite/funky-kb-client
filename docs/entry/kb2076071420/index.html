    <h3>IIS and MS Office Applications: Flippant Remarks</h3>

<pre>
<p>Eventually some under-informed bozo may suggest using a web server to automate Microsoft Office applications. I used to summarily dismiss this talk as another Homer Simpson overdosing on the doughnuts. However, as I get older and more tolerant I realize that I must explore the possibility that this so-called bozo is suggesting that we stream IIS responses back to the client using MIME types based on Microsoft Office formats. In a low-traffic Intranet environment it may not be such a &quot;stupid&quot; idea to stream an Excel spreadsheet into a web browser.</p>
<p>The MS KB article &quot;INFO: Considerations for Server-Side Automation of Office&quot; (Q257757) goes into more detail:</p>
