    <h3>USING ALUMINUM COOKWARE</h3>

<pre>
<p>by Lindsay Edwards</p>
<p>Anodization is a process that makes aluminum cookware scratch-resistant and prevents the cookware from reacting with foods prepared in it. People who like to cook prefer anodized aluminum over stainless steel because it's harder, conducts heat better, and remains nonstick for life.</p>
<p>The safety of cooking in aluminum pots and pans has been under debate recently. Studies have shown that aluminum deposits exist in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. There is speculation that these deposits might have occurred in conjunction with aluminum cookware, but this theory has not been proven. It's possible that people are getting more aluminum from over-the-counter medications than they are from food prepared in aluminum cookware.</p>
