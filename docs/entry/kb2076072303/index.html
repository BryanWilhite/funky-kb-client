<p>What are attributes?</p>
<p>All HTML elements can have associated properties, called attributes. These attributes generally have values. Any number of attribute/value pairs can be used in an element's tag - as long as they are separated by spaces. They may appear in any order.</p>
<p>In the example below, the code segments highlighted in blue are attributes and the segments highlighted in red are attribute values.
&lt;h1 id=&quot;section1&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;small.gif&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;100&quot;&gt;
&lt;img title=&quot;mainimage&quot; alt=&quot;main image&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;foo.htm&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;maintext&quot;&gt;
&lt;form style=&quot;padding: 10px&quot;&gt;
Attribute selectors</p>
<p>Attribute selectors are used to select elements based on their attributes or attribute value. For example, you may want to select any image on an HTML page that is called &quot;small.gif&quot;. This could be done with the rule below, that will only target images with the chosen name:
img[src=&quot;small.gif&quot;] { border: 1px solid #000; }</p>
<p>There are four types of attribute selectors.</p>
<p>The first option is to select based on attribute. The example below will select an element (in this case &quot;img&quot;) with the relevant attribute. Examples could include:
img[title] { border: 1px solid #000; }
img[width] { border: 1px solid #000; }
img[alt] { border: 1px solid #000; }</p>
<p>The second option is to select based on value. The example below will select any image whose attribute (in this case &quot;src&quot;) has a value of &quot;small.gif&quot;.
img[src=&quot;small.gif&quot;] { border: 1px solid #000; }</p>
<p>The third method will select space separated instances of a value. The example below will select any image whose attribute (in this case &quot;alt&quot;) contains a space separated list of words - in this case any &quot;alt&quot; that includes the word &quot;small&quot;.
img[alt~=&quot;small&quot;] { border: 1px solid #000; }</p>
<p>The fourth method will select hyphen separated instances of a value. The example below will select any image whose attribute (in this case &quot;title&quot;) has a hyphen separated list - in this case any title that includes &quot;small-&quot;.
img[title|=&quot;small&quot;] { border: 1px solid #000; }</p>
<p>Attribute selectors are not supported by Windows Internet Explorer 5, 5.5 and 6 or Macintosh Internet Explorer 5. They are also not supported by earlier versions of Opera.</p>
