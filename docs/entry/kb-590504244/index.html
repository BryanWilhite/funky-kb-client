    <h3>GETTING VITAMIN C FROM FOODS, NOT PILLS</h3>

<pre>
<p>Although there is current discussion to more than double the current 60 milligram recommendation for vitamin C to help protect against some diseases and degenerative effects of aging, you should turn to fruits and vegetables instead of supplements to bump up your intake.</p>
<p>Many fruits and vegetables are naturally rich in vitamin C, as well as other important vitamins, minerals, and fiber. So go natural--make consuming five servings of fruits and vegetables a daily commitment.</p>
<p>Foods naturally rich in vitamin C:</p>
<p>Strawberries: 1 cup, sliced; 95 mg
Red or green pepper, raw: 1/2 cup; 65 mg<br>
Papaya: 1 cup, cubed; 85 mg
Red or green pepper, cooked: 1/2 cup; 50 mg<br>
Kiwi: 1 medium; 75 mg
Broccoli, cooked: 1/2 cup; 60 mg
Orange: 1 medium; 70 mg
Kale, cooked: 1 cup; 55 mg
Cantaloupe: 1/4 medium; 60 mg
Brussels sprouts, cooked: 1/2 cup; 50 mg
Orange juice: 1/2 cup; 50 mg
Potato, baked, with skin: 1 medium; 25 mg
Mango: 1 cup, sliced; 45 mg
Grapefruit: 1/2 medium; 40 mg
Grapefruit juice: 1/2 cup; 35 mg</p>
<p>In addition to easily providing between 100 to 200 milligrams of vitamin C, consuming five servings of fruits and vegetables each day provides other important and disease-fighting vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Studies have shown that people who consume diets providing 200 milligrams of vitamin C per day through fruits and vegetables have a lower incidence of some cancers, especially cancers of the oral cavity, esophagus, stomach, colon, and lung. However, people who simply consume vitamin C supplements do not appear to experience the same protective effect.</p>
