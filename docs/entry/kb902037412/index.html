<p>Important Concept to Understand:</p>
<p>The mixer sits between the inputs and the speakers/monitors (outputs). All connections should show an understanding of this concept.</p>
<p>Important Items from the Manual:</p>
<p>Meters (page 9) --- 'AVG' (average) LEDs indicate normal output; 'PK' (Peak) indicate overload.</p>
<p>Mic Power (page 9) --- press this button when using condenser microphones.</p>
<p>Wild Guesses:</p>
<p>Calibrate the mixer's peak level against the &quot;red&quot; levels of the computer's level meters (software). I generated a sound that peaks at -6dB and adjusted levels on the mixer to &quot;almost&quot; go into the red when this sound is playing.</p>
<p>Use the Pre-Amp knobs before resorting to volume knobs: keep volume at zero.</p>
<p>Unwanted Noise:</p>
<p>So far I am very pleased with this tool. The only time I heard it hum was when I set the Power Pack (AC Adapter) too close to the main console. So now I try to keep the Power Pack away from the main console.</p>
