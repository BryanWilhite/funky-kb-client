<p>“I always click on a link to download a file and wait for a firefox window to appear. This window contains two options: &quot;Open with &quot; and &quot;Save to Disk&quot;, and three buttons: &quot;Browse...&quot;, &quot;OK&quot; and &quot;Cancel&quot;.”</p>
<p>“The problem is that &quot;OK&quot; button is playing up. Very often it's inactive. Sometimes clicking on the &quot;Browse...&quot; button or shuffling between &quot;Open with&quot; and &quot;Save to Disk&quot; or closing the window and trying to click on the link again magically makes it active. Sometimes it remains dead forever, though. See the picture attached.”</p>
<p>For me this problem went away when the window containing the buttons is not a pop-up window.</p>
