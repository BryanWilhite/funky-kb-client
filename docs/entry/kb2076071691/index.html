<p>Make sure to pass scalar values as external parameters to style sheets. Don't send XPath queries as parameters---especially an XPath query with a predicate like this:</p>
<p>/plays/playwright[last_name='Shakespeare']</p>
<p>It is better to just send the scalar text value:</p>
<p>'Shakespeare'</p>
<p>The MSXML engine, for example, will 'silently' fail providing no clues whatsoever about its type-resolution problems. Avoid the entangling mystery and keep it simple.</p>
