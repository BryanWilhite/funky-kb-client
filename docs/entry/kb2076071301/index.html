    <h3>FOODS TO FIGHT CONSTIPATION</h3>

<pre>
<p>By Lindsay Edwards</p>
<p>Constipation can be a real discomfort for anyone. There are many foods that act as natural laxatives. Some of the most common natural laxatives include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fiber: it helps to bulk up stools and, when consumed with plenty of water, starts mobility in the intestine. High-fiber foods include whole grains, fruits, peas, and beans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fruit juice: apple, pear, and grape fruit juices are particularly effective in young children because they're high in naturally occurring sugars that are difficult for young intestines to digest. Use only a little of these juices to help with constipation, since they can often cause loose stools and diarrhea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prunes: they naturally stimulate contractions of the intestines to remove waste products. Prunes also attract water to the intestinal area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fluids: drink plenty of fluids to soften stools. Avoid any liquid with caffeine, because caffeine acts as a diuretic.</p>
</li>
</ul>
