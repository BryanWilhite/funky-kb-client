    <h3>Linked Tables; Referential Integrity Enforced for Native Jet Tables</h3>

<pre>
<p>For attached tables in native Jet format (Access attached tables), referential integrity rules are enforced in the originating .MDB file. You cannot &quot;re-establish&quot; a relationship between linked tables that already have referential integrity defined elsewhere.</p>
<p>In the Relationship window the nature of their link will be deemed &quot;Indeterminate&quot; instead of many-to-many or one-to-one. Recall that, in general, indeterminate relationships are due to one or more tables having no indexes defined.</p>
