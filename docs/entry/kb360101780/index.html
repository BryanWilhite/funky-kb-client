    <h3>The 99 Billion Limit for Non-Integer Numeric Data</h3>

<pre>
<p>The note under Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications entitled &quot;Review of the Data Type Summary: Floating Point Numbers&quot; concludes that 99 billion is the highest decimal number that can be stored in an Access (DAO) database. This is true only under the following conditions:</p>
<p>The use of the CCur() is ruled out because its behavior changes with the Regional Settings of the operating system.</p>
<p>One or more numbers in the database will require accuracy out to four decimal places.</p>
<p>The use of CDbl() cannot be ruled out because the design requires a type conversion function.</p>
