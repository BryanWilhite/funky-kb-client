<p>VMware includes the ability to copy and paste to and from your virtual machine window. To enable this, you will need to install the VMware tools inside your virtual machine.</p>
<p>Once your VMware tools are installed, you will want to launch the vmware toolbox utility, which must be running if you want copy and paste to work.</p>
