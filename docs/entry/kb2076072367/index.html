<p>You may be wondering what the weird '/' is for in the binding. We couldn't just use {Binding} here and specify no Path (the default property in a binding markup extension) as the binding wouldn't 'fallback' as we described above, it would just bind to the collection. No good, we want the current item.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is this forward slash syntax which effectively takes the form &lt;collection&gt;/&lt;current-item-property&gt;.</p>
