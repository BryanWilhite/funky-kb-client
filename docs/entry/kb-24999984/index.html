    <h3>Recording: Microphones &quot;Buyer's Guide&quot;; the Purpose of Headphones</h3>

<pre>
<p>Videomaker Magazine 7/95 p.60: an entry-level mic is dynamic and unidirectional. Rec brands: Azden DX-431 ($30); Audio-Technica ATR30 ($60).</p>
<p>The Shure SM-57 is a durable and versatile microphone. The Shure SM-58 is another inexpensive choice for recording vocals.</p>
<p>The quality of headphones is not really an issue if the are meant as a &quot;reference monitor&quot; for the vocalist. Any decent pair of headphones will do this job.</p>
<p>samash.com: AKG C1000S Microphone. Excellent vocal microphone works perfect even from a greater distance, e.g. for picking up choirs and so on. Outstanding performance when used for instruments. Ideal for home recording applications. A special converter (PPC 1000) turns the microphone characteristics from cardioid into hypercardioid, if it is mounted on the mic top. The new PB 1000 Presence Boost Adapter provides an additional 5-dB high-frequency peak in the cardioid mode adding brilliance in the 5 to 9 kHz range.</p>
