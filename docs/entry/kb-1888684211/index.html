<p>The general form for the file protocol in the Windows environments is:</p>
<pre><code>file:///&amp;lt;drive letter&amp;gt;|&amp;lt;path&amp;gt;
</code></pre>
<p>where &lt;path&gt; mimics the Unix-like forward slash ('/') format. So if you are trying to use the Active Desktop with a custom home page that points to local folders on your hard drive, this protocol suddenly becomes useful. This format also works on Netscape browsers in Windows.</p>
<p>For example, to link to a folder called &quot;foo&quot; on drive &quot;C:&quot; we have:</p>
<pre><code>file:///C|/foo
</code></pre>
