<p>Use the Auto32ld Visual Basic Project file in the VB4 application directory to load custom controls by default that are usually loaded per project via the Custom Controls dialog box. In fact you may need to manually add the controls then view the corresponding project file in a text editor to see what the &quot;Object=&quot; entry is. Cut and paste this entry into Auto32ld.</p>
