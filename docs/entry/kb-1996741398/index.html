    <h3>THE WONDERS OF DILL SEED</h3>

<pre>
<p>Dill seed is an excellent herb for settling an upset stomach, is safe for children, and can be made into a tea. It breaks up gas bubbles in the stomach and prevents flatulence. It contains natural preservative properties and thus has long been used to make food safer. Dr. Daniel Mowrey, director of the American Phytotherapy Laboratory in Salt Lake City says that it also inhibits the growth of Staphylococcus, E. coli, Streptococcus, and Pseudomonas.</p>
