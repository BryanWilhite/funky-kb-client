<p>To add a user, use the useradd command or the adduser command:</p>
<pre><code>sudo useradd -d /home/testuser -m testuser

sudo passwd testuser
</code></pre>
<p>“The adduser command is even easier than the useradd command, because it prompts you for each piece of information. I find it slightly funny that there are two virtually identically named commands that do the same thing, but that's linux for you.”</p>
