<p>If marriage is the foundation of our society, as
conservatives like to claim, we're headed for trouble. The
Census Bureau said Thursday that 56 percent of American
adults were married and living with their partners in 1998,
down from 68 percent in 1970, 62 percent in 1980, and 59
percent in 1990. And more to disturb traditionalists: About
28 percent of children now live with just one parent, a huge
rise from 1970 when 12 percent were raised by
single parents.</p>
