<p>2.1.2 Renderers</p>
<p>&quot;When components render themselves, it's called the direct implementation model, but JSF also supports the delegated implementation model...&quot; The classes that implement these implementation models are called &quot;renderers.&quot; All of the standard JSF components use the delegated implementation model.</p>
<p>&quot;Renderers are organized into render kits... JSF ships with a standard render kit for HTML 4.01...&quot;</p>
<p>It is important to understand that renderers implement encoding and decoding for the response and the request, respectively. &quot;Because all encoding and encoding is handled by a single entity... the visual representation of the component and the underlying protocol for translating between request parameters and objects on the server are nicely self-contained.&quot;</p>
<p>It follows that the ability to change a render kit means that &quot;displaying a different markup language is just a matter of changing the render kit.&quot;</p>
<p>2.1.3 Validators</p>
<p>&quot;Faces handles validation in three ways---at the UI component level [declaratively], via validator methods in backing beans, or in validator classes.&quot;</p>
<p>Here is an example of declarative validation:</p>
<pre><code>&amp;lt;h:inputText&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;f:validateLength minimum=&amp;quot;2&amp;quot; maximum=&amp;quot;10&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/h:inputText&amp;gt;
</code></pre>
