<p>If you have ever developed on SharePoint, there's gotta be at least once when you came across the superbly detailed error message:</p>
<p>“Unknown error” …and its likes.</p>
<p>That's when we have to start ploughing through the humungous amount of log entries in &quot;%programfiles%\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared\\Web Server Extensions\\12\\Logs&quot;. Well, but there’s an easier way—the log files doesn’t have to be humungous!</p>
<p>We can throttle the log file outputs, depending on which area of SharePoint that we are working on. From the SharePoint Central Administration, navigate to Operations and Diagnostic Logging.</p>
