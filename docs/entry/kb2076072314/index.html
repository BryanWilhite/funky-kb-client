    <h3>CSS Child Selectors and Descendant Selectors; Microsoft Internet Explorer Limitations; webmasterworld.com</h3>

<pre>
<p>selector[1] &gt; selector[2]{
[property]: value
}</p>
<p>This is called the child selector. In browsers that support it (all but IE), it applies the styles to selector2 child elements of selector1.</p>
<p>For instance, if you had this code...</p>
<p>html:
&lt;div id=&quot;box&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</p>
<p>…and you wanted all of the paragraphs in it to have blue text, you could use the child selector...</p>
<p>css:
#box &gt; p{
color:blue;
}</p>
<p>…which applies it's styles to all the &lt;p&gt; children of #box. This is similar to the decendant selector...</p>
<p>css:
#box p {
color:blue;
}</p>
<p>…which in this situation would work identically, but it's a little different. The decendant selector will apply to ALL decendants (elements nested in any element that is nested in #box), whereas the child selector applies only to the direct children of the parent (elements nested in #box).</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>We'll need slightly more complicated code to see this...</p>
<p>html:
&lt;div id=&quot;box&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</p>
<p>Applying the same css to this, the child selector would color only the first two paragraphs blue, but would leave the other two, the one's inside of the non-IDed div, at the default text color. The descendant selector, however, would color all four paragraphs blue since they are all decendants (two children, two grandchildren) of the parent #box.</p>
<p>Going by this &quot;official&quot; application, the child selector's usefulness is limited to situations in which the order of nesting requires applying styles to child elements but not grand- (or great-grand) child elements.</p>
<p>It has another use, however, that stems from IE's conspicuous lack of support for it.</p>
<p>Since no IE browser recognizes the child selector, it is often used as a way to feed other browsers style information that must be hidden from IE. There's a good chance that this is what it is doing in the code you've seen.</p>
