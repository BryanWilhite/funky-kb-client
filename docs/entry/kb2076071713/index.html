    <h3>MCAD/MCSD Notes: Chapter 8, Lesson 5; Providing Secure Communication</h3>

<pre>
<p>Lesson 5: Providing Secure Communication</p>
<p>The purpose of this lesson is to explain how Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) communication is implemented with IIS configuration and URIs.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;To provide secure communication across the Internet, IIS supports a standardized means of encrypting and decrypting Web requests and responses.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>A third-party corporate authority provides an encryption key called a &quot;server certificate&quot; for cryptographic communication on the SSL.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;The Secure Sockets Layer&quot; (SSL) is the standard means of ensuring that data sent over the Internet can't be read by others.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>One article, &quot;Enabling SSL in IIS on Windows XP Professional,&quot; shows how to set up SSL for testing purposes using SSL:</p>

</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Because the difference between using http and https is a somewhat obscure distinction for most users to remember, it's important to provide an http entry point for your application that links to the secure (HTTPS) pages.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>The Blog post &quot;Setting up SSL correctly with IIS and ASP.NET&quot; by Paul Wilson touches upon this matter:</p>
