    <h3>FOOD LABEL CONFUSION</h3>

<pre>
<p>By Lindsay Edwards</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered what the different statements on food labels mean, such as &quot;sell by,&quot; &quot;use by,&quot; &quot;expires on,&quot; and &quot;best if used by&quot;? What about those long codes on the tops of food cans?</p>
<p>Here's the lowdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sell by: Manufacturers use the &quot;sell by&quot; statement to tell how long a store should have the product on its shelf. Do not buy a product if the sell-by date has passed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use by: Manufacturers use the &quot;use by&quot; date to warn consumers of the last date the product should be consumed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expires on: Egg cartons are basically the only places you'll find this food label. Manufacturers use the &quot;expires on&quot; date to indicate the last date the store may sell eggs as fresh.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Best if used by: When you consume the product before the &quot;best if used by&quot; date, you're getting the best flavor and quality from the product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Codes: Manufacturers use packing numbers as a tracking mechanism. The coding is also useful in the event a product is recalled.</p>
</li>
</ul>
