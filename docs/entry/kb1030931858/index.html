    <h3>MAKE TIME FOR THYME</h3>

<pre>
<p>By Brigitte Mars, for healthshop.com</p>
<p>Thyme (Thymus vulgaris), the common cooking herb, has shown powerful activity in the test tube against microbes like candida and strep. This member of the mint family is easy to grow. When included in cough syrups, it is an expectorant. When added to a bath (tied into a wash cloth), it helps relieve sore muscles.</p>
