<p>T. Berners-Lee and others (of The Internet Society) write of URIs: &quot;A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact string of characters for identifying an abstract or physical resource.&quot; The URL is considered a &quot;subset&quot; of the URI, by the way. The syntax for relative URIs have escaped my understanding for a large time.</p>
<p>What I see now centers upon understanding what the period ('.') and the double period ('..') means to Microsoft- or certain Unix-based command line syntax. In such syntax, the single period means &quot;the current directory&quot; and the double period means &quot;the directory immediately above this directory.&quot; When I apply this syntax to the relative URI, they begin make sense to me.</p>
<p>In the relative URI, the forward slash '/' is used as a delimeter, marking the number of directories above the current directory. The forward slash is the obvious choice because of its use in Unix shells.</p>
<p>Now with the single period, double periods, and the forward slash, I have a &quot;relatively&quot; complete understanding of URIs. The following are examples of &quot;Normal&quot; URIs:</p>
<pre><code>SRC=&amp;quot;./bitmaps/foo.gif&amp;quot; ---the source is the GIF image &amp;quot;foo.gif&amp;quot; in the &amp;quot;bitmaps&amp;quot; directory. This directory is immediately below the current directory.

SRC=&amp;quot;../bitmaps/foo.gif&amp;quot; ---the source is the GIF image &amp;quot;foo.gif&amp;quot; in the &amp;quot;bitmaps&amp;quot; directory. This directory is immediately above the current directory.

SRC=&amp;quot;../../bitmaps/foo.gif&amp;quot; ---the source is the GIF image &amp;quot;foo.gif&amp;quot; in the &amp;quot;bitmaps&amp;quot; directory. This directory is two directories above the current directory.
</code></pre>
<p>&quot;Abnormal&quot; URIs:</p>
<p>The double period(s) and its delimiter(s) should always lead the URI. This means that SRC=&quot;bitmaps/../../foo.gif&quot; would be what the Internet Society calls &quot;abnormal.&quot;</p>
<p>The single period should only be used once so that &quot;././foo.gif&quot; would also be very abnormal. There can only be one current directory!</p>
