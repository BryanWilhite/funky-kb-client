<p>Wireless Air Link bit rate: with 11g: 54Mbps max. With 11n: same. These rates are achieved only with short distances, few walls, and ideal interference conditions.</p>
<p>With 11n AND channel-pair-bonding: 108Mbps. But channel pair bonding is (a) rude as it uses 2/3 of the entire shared band and (b) is often automatically disabled if there are any non-11n networks on any of the 12 affected channel numbers. So 11n is great for hermits.</p>
<p>Windows normally reports the Wireless Air Link in the WiFi status. As it will with an ethernet, say, 1Gbps connection but few PCs can push more than 75% of that speed.</p>
<p>A throughput test at the IP layer, which includes all wireless and TCP/IP overhead, will typically show the yield is a bit less than 1/2 of the Air Link rate. This is because of things like 802.11 is half-duplex, waits for an ACK from the receiving side before sending more (unless you use a particular proprietary/non-standard frame bursting), bits lost to error detection and correction overhead, retransmissions due to interference on same/adjacent channels, and so on.</p>
<p>The WiFi marketing guys prey on the gullible public. As do the lotteries.</p>
