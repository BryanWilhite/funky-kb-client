    <h3>PHP 5.0.4 Installation Notes</h3>

<pre>
<p>The &quot;advanced&quot; installation option allows the php 'root' folder to be selected among other bits.</p>
<p>upload_tmp_dir and session.save_path values may need to be enclosed in quotes to prevent parsing errors for unexpected characters.</p>
<p>the \\ext folder under the php root needs to be installed by hand after the automated install from the compressed archive php-pecl-5.0.4-Win32. For MySQL use, libmysql.dll and ntwdblib.dll libraries need to be in the php root folder.</p>
<p>PECL stands for &quot;PHP Extension Community Library&quot; and is maintained at http://pecl.php.net but can be downloaded with the installer at http://php.net.</p>
<p>The extensions currently used by Songhay System are: php_mysql.dll, php_mysqli.dll, php_soap.dll, php_sockets.dll, php_tidy.dll and php_xsl.dll. (These modules are loaded by extension_dir = &quot;./ext&quot; in php.ini.)</p>
