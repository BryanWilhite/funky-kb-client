    <h3>Core Data Services for DAO; Migration to ADO from DAO; Access 2000</h3>

<pre>
<p>Every application that I build means to reflect the three-tier abstract model within Microsoft's software design guidelines. One of those tiers is Data Services. With Access 2000 and ADO in mind, I have distilled the core data services of a DAO (native ISAM) Access application.</p>
<p>Here are the current tools:</p>
<p>One Private, module-level, Recordset Object Variable</p>
<p>All of the procedure designs that take advantage of Recordset objects see this variable. Frequently in my designs, the procedure needs to loop through a set of records or add records to a table---here I find such a variable useful.</p>
<p>One Function, Returning a Recordset Object</p>
<p>This function serves the Module-level Object Variable. Currently it passes arguments for only one Parameter (for parameterized queries). It needs to distinguish between tables and compiled queries.</p>
<p>One Function That Executes Action Queries</p>
<p>This function returns a value of type Long, indicating the number of records affected by the Action Query. This function replaces the &quot;seductive&quot; functionality of the DoCmd.RunSQL() method of the Application object.</p>
<p>One Function, Returning a Single Value from a Database Object</p>
<p>This function replaces the Dlookup() method of the Application object. It takes a SQL WHERE clause among its arguments and returns a Variant.</p>
<p>One Function, Returning String from tblStrings</p>
<p>All of my Visual Basic applications store their String Literals in a DAO table called tblStrings. I built a &quot;special&quot; function that is optimized to read from this table. This function features the Seek method of the DAO.Recordset object.</p>
