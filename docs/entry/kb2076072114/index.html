<p>When you try to install Powershell 2.0, you are prompted to uninstall other versions of Powershells before going ahead with the installation. But neither does powershell appear in Add/Remove programs nor is there an uninstall shortcut in the programs menu.</p>
<p>To uninstall powershell 1.0 run add/remove programs (appwiz.cpl from Win+R) and click the “show updates” checkbox. Powershell will now be shown.</p>
