<pre>
<p>Now, here is where factors of subtle indoctrination come into play. Despite most of our ancestors having no vision or desires to take part in an Americanized future, if you notice closely, you’ll find that the media and literature nowadays will cunningly refer to slaves as “Americans” or “African Americans.” A most extreme example of this is found with Nat Turner, who in no way has any intentions to be Americanized to any extent whatsoever. Yet the authors of the biographical section of Webster’s have taken the historical liberty to write that Turner was an “American leader of a slave rebellion.”</p>
<p>Some people may regard this point as trivial or say that I am raising unnecessary controversy. But any suggestion of slaves being “Americans” sugarcoats the harshness of their reality, and should therefore be regarded as an insulting and misleading edit of history.</p>
