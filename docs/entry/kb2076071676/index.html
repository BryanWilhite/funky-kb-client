    <h3>InfoPath: Fully Trusted Forms and Direct Connections to SQL Server; &quot;ADO Security Warning&quot; Errors</h3>

<pre>
<p>By making your form fully trusted, you can avoid the annoying &quot;ADO Security Warning&quot; messages that suggest a communication problem among development teams at Microsoft. You can make your form Fully Trusted by selecting Tools &gt; Form Options &gt; Security. You will then see that you have to sign your form with a Digital Signature. This may be a show stopper but you can generate one just for your machine/domain with the Digital Certificate for VBA Projects tool. For more information about this tool please see:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>After you sign the form then go to Tools &gt; Options &gt; General &gt; Security Options and check &quot;Allow fully trusted forms to have access to files and settings on my computer.&quot; This should stop ADO error messages but other security messages (especially ones from Internet Explorer) are still out there... lurking...</p>
