<p>I have encountered Insert and Delete errors after replication synchronization when the replicable objects include two tables in a one-to-many relationship. Delete errors seem to appear when only one record in the &quot;many-side&quot; table, relating to one record in the &quot;one-side&quot; table, is deleted from one member of the replica set. Insert errors seem to appear when one or more records in the many-side table, relating to one newly added record in the one-side table, are added.</p>
<p>These observations are entirely empirical and when these errors occur they are hard to sort out. Since I use replication on very simple databases (with only one user), I simply build a new database and create a new Replica set.</p>
