<p>To search for text like '[foo]' and '[bar]' where the brackets are seen as literals we can use the LIKE operator in the WHERE predicate:</p>
<pre><code>...
WHERE [ColumName] LIKE '[[]%]'
</code></pre>
<p>This is covered in detail under &quot;Using Wildcard Characters as Literals&quot; in the SQL Books Online documentation here:</p>
