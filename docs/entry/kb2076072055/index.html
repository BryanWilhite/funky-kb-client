<p>“Long Paths—WebDav has a limit of 260 chars, and so does MOSS/WSS [or less].”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Weird files with inter-file references—the most common problem here includes Excel spreadsheets that are typically peppered with references to data stored in other excel files…”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Weird file names—Infrequently users will have filenames that are like test...txt or test#%.txt as a requirement of some application, or as part of a file naming standard.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>According to “Is the File Server Dead?” by Joel Oleson, these are valid uses of the File System over SharePoint:</p>
<ul>
<li>Product Distribution (Product packages like Office)</li>
<li>SMS distribution point (desktop patches and hot fixes)</li>
<li>NT Backups, Backup Servers and Desktop Backups</li>
<li>Database Storage</li>
<li>Large Audio/Video and Streaming Media and other large archive read only media such as DVDs, CDs storage (.iso, .wmv, .ram, .vhd)</li>
<li>Developer Source Control</li>
<li>Batch, Command Scripts, Executables (.exe, .vbs, .cmd, .bat)</li>
<li>Application Server... Client Application Storage Linked Files and File Dependencies -  (.lnk, .lck)</li>
<li>Archives and Dumps (.arj, .rar, .zip, .dmp, .bak)</li>
</ul>
