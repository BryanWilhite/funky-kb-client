<p>A new System.Uri accepts data in its constructor. Any subsequent usage of this object is on a read-only basis. A new System.UriBuilder supports read-write assignments after construction.</p>
<p>From Microsoft, “The UriBuilder class provides a convenient way to modify the contents of a Uri instance without creating a new Uri instance for each modification.” More information:</p>
<pre><code>http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.uribuilder.aspx
</code></pre>
<p>The “contents” of the Uri are exposed by the UriBuilder as shown in PowerShell like this:</p>
<p>Fragment : #hash
Host     : localhost
Password : MyPassword
Path     : /Folder1/Folder2
Port     : 999
Query    : ?var1=foo&amp;var2=bar
Scheme   : http
Uri      : http://User1:MyPassword@localhost:999/Folder1/Folder2
?var1=foo&amp;var2=bar#hash
UserName : User1</p>
<p>You should be able to see that all the members of UriBuilder (except UriBuilder.Uri) are used to “build” UriBuilder.Uri.</p>
