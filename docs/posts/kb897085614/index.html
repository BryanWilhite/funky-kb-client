<p>Opening the Database and Instancing the Recordset</p>
<p>To open the database and instance the Recordset object behind one unbound form, the following design is recommended:</p>
<p>Use module-level variables of type Recordset and Database.</p>
<p>The load event of the form should call one or more functions of type boolean that return true when the .MDB file (the database) is opened sucessfully and when a record set is ready. When these conditions are met, a procedure should be called to display the data. The form on page 17-2 shows only one record at a time. This design avoids the complex issues associated with showing several rows of editable data.</p>
<p>The form should have navigation buttons.</p>
<p>The form should have &quot;find,&quot; &quot;new record,&quot; &quot;delete,&quot; and &quot;close&quot; buttons.</p>
<p>There should be module-level variables of type Boolean that track when data is being changed or added.</p>
<p>Displaying Data on the Form</p>
<p>Page 17-7 shows the procedure used to display data one record at a time. Note that database records can contain Null values, but VB TextBox controls cannot handle Nulls. The way to avoid this problem is to concatenate a zero-length string to the value of Recordset.Fields(&lt;index&gt;). Since the value Empty is equivalent to a zero-length string we have the form</p>
<pre><code>With rsDAO
    If .RecordCount Then
        txtControl1.Text = .Fields(&amp;quot;Field1&amp;quot;) &amp; Empty
        txtControl2.Text = .Fields(&amp;quot;Field2&amp;quot;) &amp; Empty
        txtControl3.Text = .Fields(&amp;quot;Field3&amp;quot;) &amp; Empty
    End If
End With
</code></pre>
<p>Or, using the style in the book, we have the form</p>
<pre><code>With rsDAO
    If .RecordCount &amp;gt;0 Then
        txtControl1.Text = !Field1 &amp; Empty
        txtControl2.Text = !Field2 &amp; Empty
        txtControl3.Text = !Field3 &amp; Empty
    End If
End With
</code></pre>
<p>which does not reflect the fact that database fields are part of a collection. To quickly verifiy that this concatenation actually works, type the following in the Immediate (Debug) Window:</p>
<pre><code>?Null &amp; Empty = Empty
</code></pre>
<p>This should return True.</p>
