<p>This problem may not always be caused by a duplicate value trying to enter a unique index. There may also be a one-to-many relationship defined in the Relationships window where a change to the index on the one side of the relationship causes a key violation. Check the Relationships Window for such one-to-many relationships. Remove them (by deleting their link---not by hiding the tables) if necessary.</p>
