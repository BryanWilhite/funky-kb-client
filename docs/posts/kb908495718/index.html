<p>ADO Objects are not found in a hierarchy; they logically lie side by side. For example, the Command, Connection and Recordset objects can open a connection to a database. It is up to the programmer to decide the &quot;best&quot; way to open the connection.</p>
<p>There is no FindFirst method inside the Recordset object. There is only the Find method. Moreover there is no NoMatch property: when an ADO Recordset cannot find a row it moves to EOF (making EOF = True). WARNING: when specifying criteria strings in a Find, use single quotes only.</p>
<p>It appears that ADO cannot see DAO objects. It follows that you cannot treat a DAO query like a stored procedure. I beleive I am confined to using MS-SQL strings.</p>
<p>The AbsolutePosition property in DAO is zero-based; in ADO it is one-based.</p>
