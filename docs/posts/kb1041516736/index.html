<p>DAO: Data Access Object</p>
<p>A DAO is an automation interface for Accessing the Jet Database engine. In fact Access is an IDE/GUI for Jet. DAO is described by a containment hierarchy beginning with the DBEngine object. The DAO object hierarchy is shown on page 91.</p>
<p>CurrentDb() Makes a Comeback</p>
<p>CurrentDb() returns a second instance of the database found by DBEngine.Workspaces(0).Databases(0) or DBEngine(0)(0). Use of this previously &quot;obsolete&quot; function has been found useful in multi-user scenarios.</p>
<p>Listing All the Tables in a Database Omitting System and Hidden Tables</p>
<p>The code on page 94 (Listing 3.9) iterates through the TableDefs collection printing to the Debug window. Note the use of the bit-wise, Or comparision. This is used because the Attributes property can contain a number values stored in instrinsic contants (e.g. dbSystemObject).</p>
<p>Listing All the Select Queries in a Database</p>
<p>Listing 3.10 on page 94 features the use of the Type property of the QueryDef object. In this example, only queries of Type = dbQSelect are printed to the Debug window.</p>
