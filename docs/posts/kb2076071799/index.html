<p>2.1.1 User interface components</p>
<p>&quot;Packaging UI elements as a component... makes development easier because the core functions are encapsulated within a reusable piece of code.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The way a component looks is how it is rendered.&quot; A properly designed JSF component is &quot;renderer neutral&quot; when it behaves the same regardless of how it appears to the user.</p>
<p>JSF maintains &quot;state&quot; between HTTP requests. &quot;Faces components can remember their values between requests because the framework maintains a tree of the UI components for a given page. This component tree, called the view, is JSF's internal representation of the page, and it allows parent-child relationships... Using 'view' instead of 'page' underscores the fact that the  user's representation doesn't always have to be an HTML web page.&quot;</p>
<p>Components saved in this state tree are identified by a &quot;component identifier&quot; and multiple components can be associated into groups called &quot;facets.&quot;</p>
