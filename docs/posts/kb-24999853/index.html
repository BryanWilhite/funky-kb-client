    <title>MS-SQL and T-SQL: Deleting Records Not in Another Table - the funky knowledge base</title>

<body>


<p>Suppose Table1 has records that are not in Table2. Also suppose that Table1 and Table2 have a column named &quot;IndexColumn&quot; which can be used for an outer join.</p>
<p>We want an outer join because we want to delete the records in Table1 that are not in Table2. In MS-SQL we have:</p>
<pre><code>DELETE Table1.*
FROM Table1 LEFT JOIN Table2
ON Table1.IndexColumn = Table2.IndexColumn
WHERE ((Table2.IndexColumn Is Null));
</code></pre>
<p>Do not do this in t-SQL. Use the following instead:</p>
<pre><code>DELETE Table1
WHERE IndexColumn
NOT IN (SELECT IndexColumn FROM Table2)
</code></pre>
