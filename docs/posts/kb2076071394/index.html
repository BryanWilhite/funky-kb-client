<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued the following warning to consumers: Do not eat raw sprouts. This warning comes in response to outbreaks that have occurred among people of all ages and gender who have eaten raw sprouts like alfalfa, clover, and radish.</p>
<p>Raw sprouts have been identified as a source of food-borne illness in the United States. These illnesses result from the pathogenic bacteria salmonella and E. coli. Alfalfa and clover sprouts are the main causes, but all raw sprouts pose a potential risk.</p>
<p>In healthy adults, infections from salmonella and E. coli manifest as diarrhea, nausea, abdominal cramps, and fever that last for several days. However, in young children, the elderly, and those who have weakened immune systems, infections from these bacteria can be life threatening.</p>
