<p>If the mouse arrow jumps to the upper right-hand corner of the screen or if Windows fails to detect a mouse at start up, check the connections of the mouse serial port in the system unit and the plug into the Kensington mouse. These connections are uncommonly sensitive to stress.</p>
<p>UPDATE: I have contacted Kensington and they sent me a replacement cable free of charge. This solved the problem.</p>
