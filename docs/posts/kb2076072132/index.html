<p>So the final conclusion is that drawPath or drawTriangles gives better performance than traditional moveTo, lineTo in terms of ActionScript code execution. So you will get nice improvements with the new Graphics methods if most of the time you were wasting was sending the commands to the renderer. Otherwise in terms of rendering performance, the new Graphics methods does not really bring any performance improvements.</p>
