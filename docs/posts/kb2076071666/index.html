    <title>Windows Server 2003: Flippant Remarks about Network Time Servers; NTP - the funky knowledge base</title>

<p>The System event log can show this W32Time error: &quot;The time provider NtpClient is configured to acquire time from one or more time sources, however none of the sources are currently accessible.&quot; In the &quot;good old&quot; days of the innocent Internet you could run this command and call it day:</p>
<pre><code>net time /setsntp:tock.usno.navy.mil
</code></pre>
<p>However, times have changed (pun not really inended) and the USNO NTP Network Time Servers Web page (http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/ntp.html) clearly states that access to these time servers limited. Lowly servers like mine are excluded.</p>
<p>This is understandable and recoverable. According to ntp.isc.org there are &quot;open access&quot; time servers available for us &quot;end-users.&quot; For details see:</p>
<pre><code>http://ntp.isc.org/bin/view/Servers/NTPPoolServers
</code></pre>
<p>After all these years, it follows that our net time command is now:</p>
<pre><code>net time /setsntp:pool.ntp.org
</code></pre>
<p>One point of entry for more details about this matter with regard to Windows Server 2003, is MSKB article 816042 &quot;How to configure an authoritative time server in Windows Server 2003&quot; at:</p>
