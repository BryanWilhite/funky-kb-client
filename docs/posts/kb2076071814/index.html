<p>2.3 Basic configuration</p>
<p>&quot;Hibernate can be configured to run in almost any Java application and development environment... It’s important to understand the difference in configuring Hibernate for managed and non-managed environments...&quot;</p>
<p>Tomcat is considered an unmanaged environment because it only provides &quot;basic concurrency management via thread pooling.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A J2EE application server such as JBoss, BEA WebLogic, or IBM WebSphere implements the standard (J2EE-specific) managed environment for Java.&quot; A managed environment provides resource pooling (like database connections), transaction and security functionality.</p>
<p>&quot;Hibernate attempts to abstract the environment in which it’s deployed. In the case of a non-managed environment, Hibernate handles transactions and JDBC connections (or delegates to application code that handles these concerns). In managed environments, Hibernate integrates with container-managed transactions and datasources. Hibernate can be configured for deployment in both environments.&quot;</p>
