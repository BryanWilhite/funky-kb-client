    <title>IIS/PWS 4.0: Starting and stopping the Web Server from the Command Line; CMD Scripts - the funky knowledge base</title>

<body>


<p>There are many reasons why the Web Server needs to be stopped and started frequently. Here are two: debugging ActiveX Server Components (after they crash) and manually refreshing the IIS Server cache. I use two CMD scripts, PWSstart and PWSstop. These scripts were tested against PWS but should work with IIS as well:</p>
<p>PWSstart</p>
<pre><code>@ECHO OFF

net start w3svc
net start msftpsvc

PAUSE
</code></pre>
<p>PWSstop</p>
<pre><code>@ECHO OFF

net stop iisadmin /y

PAUSE
</code></pre>
<p>These scripts may generate error 2185 (&quot;The service name is invalid&quot;). Referring to the following list of Service Names may help resolve this problem:</p>
<p>IIS Admin Service: iisadmin
FTP Publishing Service: msftpsvc
Microsoft NNTP Service: nntpsvc
World Wide Web Publishing Service: w3svc</p>
<p>For more information, please see MS Knowledge Base articles Q236166 (&quot;Using NET STOP and NET START Commands to Force IIS Services to Re-Read the Registry&quot;) and Q189409 (&quot;INFO: Controlling the Caching of Web Pages with IIS 4.0&quot;).
Debugging ActiveX Components Consumed by a Web Browser; the Debugging Tab; Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS)
An ActiveX DLL Project contains an in-process Component looking for a process in which to be. This component ends up being a DLL. Instead of constantly making the DLL every time the code is changed, it is possible to run it on the fly in VB6. Under Project Properties &gt; Debugging, we have the Start Program and Start browser with URL options. (The Debugging Tab, by the way, is only available for ActiveX DLL projects.)</p>
<p>In the case of a browser running a script that calls Classes in the DLL, use the Start browser with URL option to call the script file via a web address. For DLLs built for MTS, this procedure will not work. For MTS you will have to build the DLL each time.</p>
<p>It is possible that the DLL will get &quot;stuck&quot; in a process and not allow the DLL to be created, throwing a &quot;Permission Denied&quot; error message. If this happens, try to shut down the hosting process. In the case of a server-side web server script the web server may have to be shut down. At the very extreme, the system must be rebooted.</p>
