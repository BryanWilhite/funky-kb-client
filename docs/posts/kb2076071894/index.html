<p>A person named Thomas O. in http://www.groupsrv.com/linux/post-755906.html answers this question with this:</p>
<p>“Resize the window to your liking and then right-click the titlebar and
in the menu that comes up choose Advanced &gt; Special Window Setting.”</p>
<p>“Go to the ‘Geometry’ pane and activate ‘Size’ and then pick ‘Apply
Initially’ in the drop-down menu.”</p>
<p>As of this writing, I refuse to believe that this is only kind of place where this information is available.</p>
