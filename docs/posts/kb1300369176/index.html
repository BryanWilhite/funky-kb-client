<p>Travelers who fail to take precautions while visiting developing countries can catch more than an eyeful of scenery.</p>
<p>To get the most out of your visit without the &quot;bug&quot; getting the better of you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Drink bottled water only. Avoid tap water and ice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Order from menus. Avoid buying from street vendors or eating from buffets, which might have been sitting out for several hours under unsanitary conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid salads and undercooked or raw seafood and meat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eat only peeled fruits and vegetables.</p>
</li>
</ul>
