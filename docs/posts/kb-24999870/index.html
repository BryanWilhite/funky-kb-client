<p>As the mouse pointer  moves among the menus and submenus under the Start Menu in the Explorer shell, submenus automatically cascade after a set amount of time the mouse arrow rests at a location with a solid-black right-pointing arrow.</p>
<p>This time is set in milliseconds in the MenuShowDelay line of the Registry. The path is</p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Control Panel\\desktop\\MenuShowDelay</p>
<p>Somehow this value was set to over 65,000 which led me to believe that something was wrong with my mouse!</p>
