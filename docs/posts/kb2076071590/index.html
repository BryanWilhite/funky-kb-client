<p>Right-clicking on a relevant Knob or clicking the MOD + button may show the External Sources menu item. Two very important menu items under External Sources are Pitchbend and MIDI-CC. These two items allow KONTAKT to react to the Pitch Bend and Modulation wheels of external MIDI controllers such as the MK4902.</p>
<p>MIDI-CC is shorthand for MIDI Continuous Controller, of the standard 128 controllers (e.g. 0 = Bank Select and 1 = Modulation). When the External Router for the MIDI-CC External Source is created enter number 1 next to MIDI-CC drop-down button to map to the Modulation wheel of the MIDI controller.</p>
