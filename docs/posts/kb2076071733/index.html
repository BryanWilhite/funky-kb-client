<p>Lesson 1: Building a Web Application</p>
<p>This lesson quickly introduces the concepts of the meta-data associated with .NET assemblies and the configuration of automatic assembly compilation with &quot;build options.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Web applications have two build options: debug and release.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>It may be better to remind us that Visual Studio solutions have two, default, build options: Debug and Release. Other configurations can be added. For more, see &quot;Default and Custom Builds&quot; at:</p>
<pre><code>http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/
    vsintro7/html/vxconprojectbuilds.asp
</code></pre>
<p>Project-level build options in the Property Pages dialog can be set for additional control over the build process.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;The application's build option and Web.config setting should agree. There is no advantage in having one set to debug and the other set to release...&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;To identify your application, open the AssemblyInfo file and enter the application's information in the assembly attributes.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These declarative attributes should not be confused with similar procedural properties in the System.Windows.Forms.Application class.</p>
