<p>DAZ Studio runs on a smaller memory footprint than Poser 4.x. It feels faster and smoother and it addresses a more &quot;professional&quot; amateur market, while Poser is locked in a strange world where a &quot;friendly&quot; pictographic interface is superior to a literate one. Poser is a great program but quite inflexible.</p>
<p>DAZ Studio opens data files from Poser 4.x and below. These files can be read directly from the %ProgramFiles%\\Curious Labs\\Poser4 folder where the Runtime folder and POSER.EXE are at the root. This folder will appear in the Content Window after it is specified by the Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Directories &gt; Poser Content Directories &gt; Add... command.</p>
<p>The DAZ Studio equivalent of the Conform to... command is the Fit to... command in the Parameters Window.</p>
<p>The Scene Window is the best way to select parts of an object. It is a first-class window unlike Poser, its tacked on Hierarchy Editor and its Current Figure/Current Element menus.</p>
