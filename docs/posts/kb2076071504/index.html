    <title>Flash ActionScript: the Differences between loadVariables() and loadVariablesNum() - the funky knowledge base</title>

<p>Flash 4 introduced loadVariables() and loadVariablesNum(). I assumed that an earlier version of Flash developed one of the functions to deprecate the other but this assumption is wrong.</p>
<p>While not running in &quot;expert mode,&quot; Flash promises to automatically switch from loadVariables() to loadVariablesNum() when an integer is entered for the level parameter. For the experts out there this implies that:</p>
<pre><code>loadVariables(&amp;quot;assets/copy.txt&amp;quot;, _root) = loadVariablesNum(&amp;quot;assets/copy.txt&amp;quot;, 0);
</code></pre>
<p>I really can't technically explain why there are two functions introduced in the same version of Flash doing the same thing. There must be political/historical account beyond my scope.</p>
