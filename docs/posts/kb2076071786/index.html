<p>From Timothy Haroutunian, Armenian Eagle:</p>
<p>diff -Bbrq folder folder2</p>
<p>-B = Ignore changes that just insert or delete blank lines.
-b = Ignore changes in amount of white space.
-r = When comparing directories, recursively compare any subdirectories found.
-q = Report only whether the files differ, not the details of the differences.</p>
