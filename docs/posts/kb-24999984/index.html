<p>samash.com: AKG C1000S Microphone. Excellent vocal microphone works perfect even from a greater distance, e.g. for picking up choirs and so on. Outstanding performance when used for instruments. Ideal for home recording applications. A special converter (PPC 1000) turns the microphone characteristics from cardioid into hypercardioid, if it is mounted on the mic top.
