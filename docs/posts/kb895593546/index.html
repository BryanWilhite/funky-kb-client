<p>Do not trivialize or underestimate the importance of VBA in Visual Basic 5.0. Every default VB project must contain the following libraries:</p>
<p>Visual Basic for Applications (VBA; VBA5.DLL)
Visual Basic Runtime Objects and Procedures (VBRUN; MSVBVM50.DLL)
Visual Basic Objects and Procedures (VB; VB5.OLB)</p>
<p>Many VB users are surprised to find out how much of VB is in VBA. For example, the Err object is instanced by the class VBA.ErrObject. Most of the VBRUN library are constants. Classes that instance controls make up a large part of the VB library. Almost everything else is in VBA.</p>
