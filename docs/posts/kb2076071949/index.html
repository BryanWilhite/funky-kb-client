<p>Impressionism</p>
<p>Among the books on color theory, Chevreul’s classic stood virtually alone until the age of Neo-Impressionism when writers like Helmhotz, Blanc, Rood, Sutter, and Henry undertook complex and elaborate dissertations. These newer theorists, however, did not publish until 1867 and after, when Chevreul was in his eighties. Thus Chevreul’s masterpiece was the one and only important text and gospel on color during the Impressionist period.</p>
