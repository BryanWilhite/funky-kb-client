    <title>XSLT Problem: The String &quot;x­mlns&quot; Can Mangle Output - the funky knowledge base</title>

<p>By simply typing the string &quot;x­mlns&quot; in an XSLT file, or inserting this string into an XSLT source XML file, XSL processing can mangle output in the PHP environments and on the .NET 2.x platform (and below).</p>
<p>The string &quot;x­mlns&quot; refers to declaring/registering a namespace in an XML document. So it is clear that this character combination has significant meaning. This mangling problem persists even when &quot;x­mlns&quot; appears in a CDATA block.</p>
<p>One horrid hack to deal with this problem (when you must deal with this problem) is to search character data and replace &quot;x­mlns&quot; with something like &quot;x[invisible character]mns&quot; where the invisible character can be, say, a soft-hyphen (­ or ­ or ­).</p>
<p>By the way, Microsoft Word users can enter Ctrl+- (control hyphen) to enter a soft hyphen. The Windows key combination is Alt+0173.</p>
