<p>1.5.1 Dissecting hello.jsp</p>
<p>The tag library indicated by http://java.sun.com/jsf/core provides for validation, event handling and the like.</p>
<p>The tag library indicated by http://java.sun.com/jsf/html provides for the JSF UI components like text boxes, output labels and forms.</p>
<p>&quot;The &lt;f:view&gt; custom tag must enclose all other Faces-related tags...&quot;</p>
<p>The HtmlOutputText component, represented by the &lt;h:outputText&gt; tag, represents all read-only text generated by JSF. It follows that the HtmlOutputLabel component (&lt;h:outputLabel&gt;) encloses an &lt;h:outputText&gt; tag to display its data.</p>
<p>The HtmlMessage component (&lt;h:message&gt;) displays validation and conversion errors for a specific component, identified by its for attribute.</p>
<p>#{helloBean.numControls} is an example of JSF Expression Language (EL) used to bind backing bean data to JSF components.</p>
<p>&quot;Faces will automatically search the different scopes of the web application (request, session, application) for the specified backing bean.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;JSF also supports validators, which are responsible for making sure that the user enters an acceptable value.&quot;</p>
<p>The HtmlPanelGrid component renders as a &lt;table&gt; element.</p>
<p>The HtmlCommandButton has action and actionListener properties that can be bound to backing bean methods. The action method takes no parameters, and returns a String which is passed to the NavigationHandler. The actionListener method takes an ActionEvent parameter and has a return type of void.</p>
<p>When HtmlCommandButton.immediate = true, this means that this component's value must be converted and validated during the Apply Request phase, rather than waiting for the Process Validations phase.</p>
