    <title>Sonic Foundry Vegas Video 3.0 PROBLEM: Save As... Dialog Appears When Render As... Command is Executed - the funky knowledge base</title>

<p>If all of the tracks are muted in a Vegas Video Project file, the Save As... dialog will appear when the Render As... Command is executed. The behavior is by design and can frustrate many a sleepy head in the middle of a pre-dawn render. Just wake up and enable at least one track!</p>
