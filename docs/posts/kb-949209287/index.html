<p>Although we all hope it never happens, it helps to know where to turn when it does---finding those &quot;things&quot; that just don't belong in your packaged food. Well, here are the numbers you'll need to know:</p>
<p>Call 1-800-535-4555, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Meat and Poultry Hotline, to report UFOs (unidentified or identified foreign objects) in meat, poultry, or egg-based foods. For the USDA to investigate a problem, you must be able to provide the original packaging or container, the foreign object, and any uneaten portion of the food.</p>
<p>Call the Food and Drug Administration to report problems with non-meat products (such as a sugar-coated bug in your cereal) or seafood. To find an FDA office near you, look under U.S. Government, Health and Human Services in your local phone directory. The Seafood Hotline is 1-800-332-4010.</p>
