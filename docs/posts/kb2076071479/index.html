<p>ADSI is for automating networking services as ADO is for automating database systems. I previously thought that ADSI was only for programmatically manipulating Active Directory (AD). I was wrong.</p>
<p>ADSI is built into Windows 2000. It is always running by default consequently the GetObject() method is used against ADSI. Microsoft introduces ADSI  in &quot;Basic ADSI&quot; which (as of this writing) is located at:</p>

<p>One advanced &quot;tips and tricks&quot; article is called &quot;Using ADSI, LDAP, and Network Management Functions With Active Directory&quot; at:</p>

<p>I also found some lengthy code examples at 15seconds.com, the article &quot;Add to Your ADSI Code Library&quot; at:</p>
