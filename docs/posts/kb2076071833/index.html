<p>According to Budge, the &quot;Sacred Ibis&quot; is in our Word for &quot;discover.&quot; Reference:</p>
<pre><code>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_Ibis
</code></pre>
<p>&quot;The Sacred Ibis occurs in marshy wetlands and mud flats, both inland and on the coast.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Venerated and often mummified by Ancient Egyptians as a symbol of the god Thoth, the Ibis was according to Herodotus and Pliny the Elder also invoked against incursions of serpents. It was also said that the flies that brought pestilence died immediately upon propitiatory sacrifices of this bird (Pliny, Natural History Book X Chapter 41).&quot;</p>
<p>Note how its beak can probe into the ground---digging. Recall that our word for &quot;study&quot; is related to the word for &quot;dig.&quot;</p>
