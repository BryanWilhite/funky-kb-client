<p>Feisty will be released around the end of Spring 2007 (April I believe). So at the time of this writing, Edgy is the most current stable version to have. For many things in Ubuntu, particularly any time you are tinkering with adding repositories, you need to know your version. If nothing else, it can make you feel a little bit more like you know what’s going on if someone asks you and you actually know what your computer is running ;)</p>
<p>It’s easy enough to do.</p>
<ol>
<li>Applications -&gt; Accessories -&gt; Terminal</li>
<li>Type the following at the prompt:
cat /etc/lsb-release</li>
<li>It should output something similar to mine, which looks like this:
DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu
DISTRIB_RELEASE=6.10
DISTRIB_CODENAME=edgy
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=&quot;Ubuntu 6.10&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>Not too hard to figure out that the line that says ‘DISTRIB_CODENAME’ is the one that tells you the name of your version. Fairly painless.</p>
