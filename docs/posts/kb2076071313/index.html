    <title>From VB 6.x to Java: Some Flippant Remarks - the funky knowledge base</title>

<p>I feel obliged to apologize before I do this: sorry. Associating VB with Java is pretty nasty. Okay:</p>
<p>VB is all about encapsulating procedures; Java is all about encapsulating data.</p>
<p>VB (as of 6.0) has modules; Java has classes. Java's equivalent of a standard module is to have a class containing the main() method. And, yes, VB has the &quot;class module.&quot;</p>
<p>VB has module-level variables; Java has instance fields.</p>
<p>VB has optional parameters; Java has overloading.</p>
