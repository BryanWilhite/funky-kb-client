<p>Valid Java programming language code must honor the Catch or Specify Requirement. This means that code that might throw certain exceptions must be enclosed by either of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A try statement that catches the exception. The try must provide a handler for the exception, as described in Catching and Handling Exceptions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A method that specifies that it can throw the exception. The method must provide a throws clause that lists the exception, as described in Specifying the Exceptions Thrown by a Method.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Code that fails to honor the Catch or Specify Requirement will not compile. â€¦Not all exceptions are subject to the Catch or Specify Requirement.</p>
