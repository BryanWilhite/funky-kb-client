<p>A schoolteacher married a laborer. They worked hard and with economy and planning managed to acquire a home and a car. Children came as planned, but conflict came and grew. The wife wanted a larger home with a yard. The husband resented her demands. He felt that she and her friends were “phony” and that she was preoccupied with maintaining senseless appearances. Their mutual hostility led to verbal and later physical assaults. Divorce was the result.</p>
