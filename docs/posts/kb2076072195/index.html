<p>The comment has to be /* @var $variable type */ . If the comment is written in the right form, then the var tag has bold font.</p>
<p>You can use this helper, when NetBeans is not able to recognize the type of the variable. On the picture below you can see that NetBeans recognizes that the variable $media in the echo statement is Book type. But then another object is assigned to the $media variable through the getLastMovie() function. This function defines the return type Movie, so from this line NetBeans knows that $media variable contains an object of Movie type.</p>
