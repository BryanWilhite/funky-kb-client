<p>I have received your submission. The style and tone of these poems in particular are outside the scope of the kinte space. Your previous submission will not be published in the kinte space.</p>
<p>According to Yahoo!(TM) there are over 500 poetry WWW sites that publish on the web. You may want to see these sites at</p>
<p>http://www.yahoo.com/Arts/Humanities/Literature/Poetry/Web_Published_Poetry/</p>
<p>In any case, please do not feel kinte-space alienated! Show your strength by visiting us anyway, to watch, listen and read what is going on here! Equally, I encourage you to continue writing and sending new  submissions to our little terrestrial project!</p>
