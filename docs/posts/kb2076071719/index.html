<p>Alexey Fadyushin of the redhat.com list archives writes: &quot;The correct way to clear history is to use 'history -c' because this will clear all history, including commands used in the session from which the command 'history -c' is given.&quot;</p>
<p>This is not as formal or effective as 'rm -f ~/.bash_history'.</p>
