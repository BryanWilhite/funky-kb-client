<p>Some of our users have recently reported seeing the following error in their rsync logs:</p>
<pre><code>rsync: Failed to dup/close: Socket operation on non-socket (108)
rsync error: error in IPC code (code 14) at pipe.c(72) [sender=3.0.3]
rsync: read error: Connection reset by peer (104)
rsync error: error in IPC code (code 14) at io.c(803) [sender=3.0.3]
</code></pre>
<p>BackupAssist 5.1 reports this error as BA3012 “Error in rsync protocol data stream”. BackupAssist 5.2 reports either BA3302 “Could not establish connection” or BA3014 “Error in IPC code”.</p>
<p>We have identified two possible causes for this error:</p>
<ol>
<li>Windows Data Execution Prevention (DEP) preventing rsync from running.</li>
<li>Another program, such as the Kaseya Agent inserting itself into the Windows networking stack</li>
</ol>
<p>To resolve the DEP issue you need to go to Control Panel &gt; System &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Data Execution Prevention.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Either change the DEP setting to “essential Windows programs and services only”, or add exceptions for the three programs required for rsync: rsync.exe, ssh.exe and ssh-keygen.exe. These programs are located in &quot;C:\\ProgramData\\BackupAssist v5\\temp\\Rsync&quot; on Windows Vista and Server 2008, or in &quot;C:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\Application Data\\BackupAssist v5\\temp\\Rsync&quot; on earlier versions of Windows.</p>
