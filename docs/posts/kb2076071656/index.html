<p>Using Command Lines with Acrobat and Acrobat Reader under Windows</p>
<p>These are unsupported command lines, but have worked for some developers. There is no documentation for these commands other than what is listed below. You can display and print a PDF file using command lines with Acrobat and Acrobat Reader.</p>
<p>AcroRd32.exe filename - Executes the Reader and displays a file.
AcroRd32.exe /p filename - Executes the Reader and prints a file.
AcroRd32.exe /t path printername drivername portname - Initiates Acrobat Reader, prints a file while suppressing the Acrobat print dialog box, then terminates Reader.</p>
<p>The four parameters of the /t option evaluate to path, printername, drivername, and portname (all strings).</p>
<p>printername - The name of your printer.</p>
<p>drivername - Your printer driver's name. Whatever appears in the Driver Used box when you view your printer's properties.</p>
<p>portname - The printer's port. portname cannot contain any &quot;/&quot; characters; if it does, output is routed to the default port for that printer.</p>
<p>If using Acrobat, substitute Acrobat.exe in place of AcroRd32.exe in the command lines.</p>
