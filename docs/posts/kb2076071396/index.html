<p>Sometimes, food stays in the refrigerator a little longer than we initially expect. If this often happens to you, then pay attention. There are certain guidelines you should follow to keep food safe, especially when it has passed its prime peak of freshness.</p>
<p>Keep the following guidelines in mind when purchasing and storing fruits:</p>
<p>Apples, grapefruit, oranges, and tangerines should be stored uncovered in the refrigerator and should be used within two weeks of purchasing.</p>
<p>Bananas should be stored at room temperature and used within two to three days after the green disappears.</p>
<p>Grapes should be stored unwashed and uncovered in the refrigerator and used within four to six days.</p>
<p>Lemons and limes should be stored uncovered in the refrigerator and used within ten days to two weeks.</p>
<p>Pears should be stored at room temperature until ripe, then stored in the refrigerator crisper. Eat pears within three to five days of purchase.</p>
