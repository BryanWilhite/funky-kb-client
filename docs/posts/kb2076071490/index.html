    <title>ASP: Flippant Remarks about Server.Execute() and Server.Transfer() - the funky knowledge base</title>

<p>Since Microsoft is characteristically silent about their own shortcomings, these flippant remarks about Server.Execute() and Server.Transfer() are extremely flippant: these new features suck; they are almost completely useless---okay, they are useless.</p>
<p>Ignoring the subtle nuance of those lovers of ASP 3.0, I say that you can't use QueryString values with Server.Execute() and Server.Transfer(). Strange or unexpected things happen to relative links when Server.Transfer() is used and just think of a really bad call to a subroutine when you think of using Server.Transfer().</p>
<p>These new features were quickly tacked on the tail-end of ASP (probably to address the power of PHP 4.x) and were abandoned in favor of ASP.NET stuff. For more details (written in a more pleasant manner for the perfumed ears of King Lear) please see:</p>
