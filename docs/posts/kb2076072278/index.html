<p>I was recently thinking if I really liked to use the Multiple assignment in 'C#' or if it was less readable. In 'C' this syntax was popular as it tended to lead to smaller and quicker code.</p>
<p>So I wondered in C# if the multiple assigment also lead to quicker code. So I quickly wrote some test cases to see which style of code was quicker to execute...</p>
<p>I took a rather simplistic model to profile, in order to make the tests more repeatable and easy to follow.</p>
<p>The .NET code followed the followed the structure:</p>
<p>[STAThread] static void Main(string[] args)
int Count1;
int  Count2;
int  Count3;
int  Count4;
int  Count5;
int  Count6;
int  Count7;
int  Count8;</p>
<pre><code>        Count1 =
        Count2 =
        Count3 =
        Count4 =
        Count5 =
        Count6 =
        Count7 =
        Count8 = 100;
        
		
        DateTime time = DateTime.Now;
        for (long i = 0; i &amp;lt; 1000000000; i++)
        {
            int  x = 100;
            Count1 = 
            Count2 = 
            Count3 = 
            Count4 = 
            Count5 = 
            Count6 = 
            Count7 = 
            Count8 = x;
        }

        TimeSpan span = DateTime.Now - time;
        Console.WriteLine(&amp;quot;Time taken{0}&amp;quot;, span.TotalMilliseconds / 1000.0);
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>Test 	.NET 1.1
Debug Mode 	.NET 1.1
under the debugger 	.NET 1.1
Release Mode
Count1=x;Count2=x;..... 	7 	7 	4.5
Count1=Count2=Count3 ...=x; 	9.5 	9.5 	4.5</p>
<p>Results are in seconds</p>
<p>I did test out directly setting the values eg Count1=100; Count2=100; etc as well as using strings. These variations appeared to give similar results. I carried out the same expermiment under .NET 2 and the results were similar just slightly slower in debug mode.</p>
<p>The machine that carried out the tests was an Intel 3.4Ghz P4 running XP SP2 with 1GB RAM.</p>
<p>I guess as ever this proves that it is more important to write readable code that requires the minimum of maintanance, rather than trying to outwit the compiler/CLR.</p>
<p>So would I use the multiple assignment? Probably not as much as I used to, but when it leads to easier to read code then yes.</p>
