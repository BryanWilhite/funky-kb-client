    <title>VB PROBLEM: Cannot Get My Code to &quot;Wait&quot; on a Form When the Form is Designed to Be a Custom Dialog Box - the funky knowledge base</title>

<p>Suppose that the form frmDialog is meant to be a custom dialog that is called from code. The form takes values (like a user name and a password) and returns them to the calling procedure. The problem is the calling procedure does not &quot;wait&quot; for the values returned from the form.</p>
<p>To stop execution of code while the frmDialog is visible, open frmDialog modally with the form:</p>
<pre><code>Call frmDialog.Show(Modal:=vbModal, _
    OwnerForm:=frmMain)
</code></pre>
<p>where frmMain is the Startup Object of the project. Now suppose that frmDialog has a Cancel button with the following Click Event:</p>
<pre><code>Private Sub cmdCancel_Click()
    CancelDialog = True
    Me.Visible = False
End Sub
</code></pre>
<p>where CancelDialog is a Public Boolean of the frmDialog. Once frmDialog.Visible = False, the calling procedure (basCallingSub()) stops waiting. The following lines of code has the form:</p>
<pre><code>If frmDialog.CancelDialog Then
    'User clicked Cancel.
    Call VB.Unload(frmDialog)
    Set frmDialog = Nothing
    GoTo basCallingSub_Exit
Else
    'Get values from frmDialog.
    With frmDialog
        strUserName = .txtUserName.Text
        strPassword = .txtPassword.Text
    End With
    Call VB.Unload(frmDialog)
    Set frmDialog = Nothing
End If
</code></pre>
<p>where the Unload() Method of the VB Object removes the frmDialog UI from memory. Setting frmDialog = Nothing removes the frmDialog code from memory such that when it is called again, its variables wil be reinitialized.</p>
