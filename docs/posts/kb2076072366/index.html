<p>You can move *.testrunconfig (and *.vsmdi) files to a new Solution for reuse. Add these as existing items into a folder called “Solution Items,” sadly it must have this name. Do have any relevant Test projects loaded in the Solution before you do this.</p>
<p>You know you are doing something wrong when you get an error message after adding these files to the Solution.</p>
