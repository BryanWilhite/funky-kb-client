<p>Recently I have been working on a WordPress plugin for Think Vitamin which necessitated getting back into the swing of PHP.</p>
<p>Whilst getting my head around how to create the plugin I started to delve into some of the core WordPress files and came across an unfamiliar yet syntactically sweet PHP control structure. It’s a simple if statement used in a file that combines PHP and HTML.</p>
<p>Old version:</p>
<p>&lt;?php if(&lt;your evaluation here&gt;) { ?&gt;
// Output
&lt;?php } else { ?&gt;
// Output
&lt;?php }; ?&gt;</p>
<p>New version: Much easier to read</p>
<p>&lt;?php if(&lt;your evaluation here&gt;): ?&gt;
// Output
&lt;?php else: ?&gt;
// Output
&lt;?php endif; ?&gt;</p>
<p>It also works on “for” and “while” loops as well as “elseif”.</p>
<p>I have never been a fan of combining HTML and PHP, preferring the separation of code and HTML offered by template engines like Smarty, but I could be persuaded. To me this is syntactically much clearer and in my opinion wouldn’t be too difficult for non “coders” working on your project to grasp.</p>
<p>Here are two further examples from WordPress:</p>
<p>&lt;?php if (have_posts()) : while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;?php if (have_posts()) : while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?&gt;
// Output
&lt;?php endwhile; else: ?&gt;
// Output
&lt;?php endif; ?&gt;</p>
<p>There are always new things to learn and learning from other people’s code is a great place to start.</p>
