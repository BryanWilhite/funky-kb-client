    <title>Microsoft Outlook 2007: Flippant Remarks about RSS Feed Support - the funky knowledge base</title>

<p>RSS feed support in Outlook 2007 is not satisfactory. It sucks. There is an article from tech-recipes.com, “Outlook 2007: Remove or Disable RSS Feed Support,” here:</p>
<pre><code>http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/

</code></pre>
<p>I recall following the instructions for “Mass Remove Feed Subscriptions from Outlook” and they did not work. I am not blaming the instructions. I am blaming Outlook. Here are the instructions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click Tools menu and then Options again.</li>
<li>Select the poorly named Mail Setup tab</li>
<li>Click the Data Files button</li>
<li>Click the RSS Feeds tab</li>
<li>Click the first feed and scroll down to the bottom of the feed list</li>
<li>Hold the SHIFT key and click the last feed. All feeds should now be selected.</li>
<li>Click the Remove button</li>
<li>Confirm you want them all deleted.</li>
</ol>
<p>Former MVP and Microsoft Employee (as of this writing) Daniel Moth has a more effective way of dealing with this crap:</p>
<ol>
<li>Close Outlook 2007 Beta 2</li>
<li>Launch Outlook 2003 and connect it to the same exchange server</li>
<li>Notice how the RSS Feeds appears as a <em>regular</em> folder in Outlook 2003 (it treats it as any other user-created folder)</li>
<li>Delete the “RSS Folder” (obviously you can't do that in O12 as it is special, as the icon indicates)</li>
</ol>
<p>For more details, see:</p>
