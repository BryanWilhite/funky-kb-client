MSDN: “Several questions have come up lately regarding whether SQL Server Express is an appropriate product to be used in a hosting environment.”

“All versions of SQL Server including Express Edition are RECOMMENDED for dedicated (single-tenant) hosting environments.”

“There is a tool called the Database Publishing Wizard (it comes bundled with Visual Studio 2008) to help the export/import process.”
