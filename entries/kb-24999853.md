Suppose Table1 has records that are not in Table2. Also suppose that Table1 and Table2 have a column named &quot;IndexColumn&quot; which can be used for an outer join.

We want an outer join because we want to delete the records in Table1 that are not in Table2. In MS-SQL we have:

    DELETE Table1.*
    FROM Table1 LEFT JOIN Table2
    ON Table1.IndexColumn = Table2.IndexColumn
    WHERE ((Table2.IndexColumn Is Null));

Do not do this in t-SQL. Use the following instead:

    DELETE Table1
    WHERE IndexColumn
    NOT IN (SELECT IndexColumn FROM Table2)
