Mod in Ordinal Extractions

In the same manner that sub-strings can be extracted from strings with the Left() function, the Mod operator can be used to extract digits from integer values:

    (19984 - (19984 Mod 10))/10 = 1998

The Mod operator used like the Right() function:

    19984 Mod 10 = 4

Thanks to the Mod operator, more traditional scalar operators can be used in concatenation-like operations:

    1998 * 10 + 4 = 19984


Mod in Boolean Evaluations

Test for an odd number with Long lngTest against the Boolean blnTest:

    blnTest = (lngTest Mod 2 = 1)

Test for an even number with Long lngTest against the Boolean blnTest:

    blnTest = (lngTest Mod 2 = 0)

Test for a multiple of six with Long lngTest against the Boolean blnTest:

    blnTest = (lngTest Mod 6 = 0)

IMPORTANT: Recall that Mod operations return the remainder in integer division. When the Long variable (lngTest) becomes involved in a Mod operation, it makes explicit the use of integers. Without lngTest, there is implicit rounding. For example:

    (13.4 Mod 2 = 13 Mod 2) = True

and

    (13.5 Mod 2 = 14 Mod 2) = True
