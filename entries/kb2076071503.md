Microsoft is so, so, so helpful. The great thing about this helpful situation is that I haven't bought a shitty technical book for many, many months. The bad thing about this is popularly called information overload.

Visual Studio.NET deals with this information with an updated MSDN Library Viewer. It comes with a Filter editor. By selecting Help &gt; Edit Filtersâ€¦ from the main menu, a whole new world opens up. User-defined filters will appear right along with the default Visual Studio.NET filters in the Help Contents and Index windows.

These are my custom filters so far:

    SQL Server Reference:
    (&quot;TargetOS&quot;=&quot;Windows&quot;) OR (&quot;Technology&quot;=&quot;SQLSrv&quot;)
    OR (&quot;Locale&quot;=&quot;kbEnglish&quot;) OR (&quot;DevLang&quot;=&quot;SQL&quot; OR &quot;DevLang&quot;=&quot;TSQL&quot;)
    OR (&quot;TopicType&quot;=&quot;kbArticle&quot;) AND (&quot;DocSet&quot;=&quot;SQL Server&quot;)
