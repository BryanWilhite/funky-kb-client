“The OK button being grayed out is documented in bug 264492. In some cases, selecting another option (e.g. &quot;Save to Disk&quot;) will reactivate the OK button so you can then reselect the &quot;Open with&quot; action to open the file with an application.”

This was a problem when a PHP page streamed a file from a link with a target attribute of &quot;_blank&quot;, causing a new window to open.
