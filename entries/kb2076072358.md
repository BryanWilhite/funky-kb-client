I've been playing with linq to entities also. It's got a long way to go before it catches up with linq to SQL. I've had to use linq to entities for the Table per Type Inheritance stuff. I found a good article recently which explains the whole 1 company 2 different ORM technologies thing here.

However you can do lazy loading, in a way, by doing this:

// Lazy Load Orders 
var alice2 = data.Customers.First(c =&gt; c.Name == &quot;Alice&quot;);

// Should Load the Orders
if (!alice2.Orders.IsLoaded)
    alice2.Orders.Load();

or you could just include the Orders in the original query:

// Include Orders in original query
var alice = data.Customers.Include(&quot;Orders&quot;).First(c =&gt; c.Name == &quot;Alice&quot;);

// Should already be loaded
if (!alice.Orders.IsLoaded)
    alice.Orders.Load();
