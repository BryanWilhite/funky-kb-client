If the mouse arrow jumps to the upper right-hand corner of the screen or if Windows fails to detect a mouse at start up, check the connections of the mouse serial port in the system unit and the plug into the Kensington mouse. These connections are uncommonly sensitive to stress.

UPDATE: I have contacted Kensington and they sent me a replacement cable free of charge. This solved the problem.
