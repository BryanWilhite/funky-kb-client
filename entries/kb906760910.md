Common DOS commands translated back to UNIX:

cd ---exactly like cd

clear ---exactly like cls

cp ---very much like copy

ls -al; df -k | more ---kind of like dir /p

mv ---very much like move

uname -sr ---kind of like ver


Other Unix commands I really need right about now:

cat ---concatenate files

chgrp -R &lt;group name&gt; &lt;folder name&gt;/* ---changes the group of &lt;folder name&gt; to &lt;group name&gt; and all of its sub-folders/files

chmod a+r &lt;filename&gt; ---makes &lt;filename&gt; readable to all

chmod a+x &lt;filename&gt; ---makes &lt;filename&gt; executable to all

chmod -R g+w &lt;folder name&gt;/* ---adds group-level write privileges to &lt;folder name&gt; and all sub-folders/files

chown -R &lt;user name&gt; &lt;folder name&gt;/* ---changes the owner of &lt;folder name&gt; to &lt;user name&gt; and all of its sub-folders/files

du -sk &lt;path name&gt; ----returns the amount of disk space &lt;path name&gt; occupies in KBs

find .  -name  &quot;*.html&quot; -print | sort ---displays a sorted list of files with &quot;.html&quot; in their names in the directory (and any subdirectories) where the command is executed

kill -9 &lt;process ID&gt; ---&quot;really&quot; stops a process with id &lt;process ID&gt;

passwd &lt;user name&gt; ---changes the password of &lt;user name&gt;

ps -fu&lt;user name&gt; ---returns the processes run by &lt;user name&gt;

rm -r &lt;folder name&gt; ---remove &lt;folder name&gt; and all of its sub-folders/files

sort -o &lt;destination file&gt; &lt;source file&gt; ---e.g.: sort -o .newsrc .newsrc

su &lt;user name&gt; ---creates the shell of &lt;user name&gt;; to terminate this session and return to the original login enter EOF (usually Ctrl+d)

tar -xvf &lt;archive name(s)&gt; ---extracts one or more tape archive files (tar files) and prints the name(s) of the file(s) stored in the archive to the console

which &lt;command name(s)&gt; ---determines which file is associated with &lt;command name(s)&gt; (separated by spaces)

who ---determines who's logged in the system

Search for literals with grep and fgrep (&quot;fast&quot; grep).

To shutdown the system use the command 

/usr/sbin/shutdown -y -g0 -i0

To start the system use boot.

Don't forget all those kick-ass compression commands like pack and compress! Also note that .tgz implies .tar.gz---which in turn implies the compression application gunzip.

Use the vacation command for vacations.
