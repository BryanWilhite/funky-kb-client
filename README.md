# the funky knowledge base

This repo stores in static files notes taken since the 1990s. I started taking notes in Microsoft Access, then I built an ASP site over SQL server, then I built a PHP site over SQLite, then I built an Angular JS site over Azure Storage BLOBs.

This _feels_ like the final resting place of my funky notes.
