There are five principles of class design (aka SOLID):

    * (SRP) The Single Responsibility Principle
    * (OCP) The Open Closed Principle
    * (LSP) The Liskov Substitution Principle
    * (ISP) The Interface Segregation Principle
    * (DIP) The Dependency Inversion Principle

There are three principles of package cohesion

    * (REP) The Reuse Release Equivalence Principle
    * (CCP) The Common Closure Principle
    * (CRP) The Common Reuse Principle

There are three principles of package coupling

    * (ADP) The Acyclic Dependencies Principle
    * (SDP) The Stable Dependencies Principle
    * (SAP) The Stable Abstractions Principle
