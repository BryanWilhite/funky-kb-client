Consider three files each containing one word:

    1.txt
    2.txt
    3.txt

This cat command, cat *.txt, produces the following output:

    One
    Two
    Three

where each word is the one word in the three text files, respectively. Now we need to store this concatenated output in a compressed gzip file:

     cat *.txt | gzip &gt; out.txt.gz

This piping is redirected into a *.gz file that contains one file, out.txt. The assumption here today is that this procedure can be used for apache log files generated by, say, vlogger.
