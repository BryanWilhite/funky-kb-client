A compiled Pass-Through Query in the QueryDefs collection of a DAO database can be referenced in code like the following:

    Set qdDAO = dbDAO.QueryDefs(`qsptTaz3Test00`)
    qdDAO.Execute DB_FAILONERROR

where `qsptTaz3Test00` is the name of the compiled Pass-Through query and `qdDAO` is the name of a QueryDef object. Calling the Execute method of the QueryDef object may generate the error, `Can't Execute a Non-Action Query.` This error will occur when the Returns Records property of the Pass-Through query is set to Yes.

Note: multiple SQL commands can be placed in an Access Pass-Through query but it is not recommended to mix select statements with SQL that does not return records like update statements.
