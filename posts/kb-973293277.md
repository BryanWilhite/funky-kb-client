Oxygen and heat easily destroy vitamin C. Because it is a water-soluble vitamin, it can also leach out into cooking liquids. 

Foods high in vitamin C include strawberries, citrus juices, red and green peppers, broccoli, kale, Brussels sprouts, and baked potatoes. 

To get the most vitamin C from the foods you buy: 

* Eat foods rich in vitamin C raw. 

* Store vitamin C-rich fruits and vegetables in the refrigerator and cut just before using. 

* Cut food into large, rather than small, pieces to minimize exposure to oxygen. 

* Keep cooking times short and use a minimum amount of water in cooking. Steaming and stir-frying are good cooking methods to use. 

* Leave skins on potatoes and use some potato cooking water when preparing mashed potatoes. 

* Cook vitamin C-rich vegetables in casseroles.
