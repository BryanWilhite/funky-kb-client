To disable System Beep sounds in Windows, the &quot;safe&quot; method is to try Tweak UI. Look under General &gt; Settings. Uncheck the Beep on errors box.

As of this writing, Tweak UI is available here:

        powertoys/xppowertoys.mspx

The other method that is guaranteed to work (but may strangely enough require reboot) uses the Device Manager. First select View &gt; Show hidden devices. Then look under Non Plug and Play Drivers for Beep. Disable Beep and reboot (when prompted).

By the way, the command-line way to call the Device Manager is this:

    %SystemRoot%&bsol;&bsol;System32&bsol;&bsol;DEVMGMT.MSC
