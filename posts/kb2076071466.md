When the BIOS setting under Power Management Setup called "State After Power Failure" is not set to Off the system unit may power up unexpectedly and immediately power off. The assumption here is that the system unit expects to be connected to a continuous power source (even when shut off) instead of a power strip that is turned on and off.
