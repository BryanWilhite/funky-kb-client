Searching for text with Regular Expressions should be straight forward. I constantly read this reference at design-time:

    ms-help://MS.VSCC/MS.MSDNVS/vsintro7/html/vxgrfregularexpressionss.htm

What was elusive to me was how to replace what I found using the Replace All command. This is done by &quot;tagging&quot; expressions with brackets {}. So the following regular expression will look for HTML numerical attributes without XHTML-friendly quotes:

    &bsol;&bsol;=[0-9]+

But this expression will not let me insert quotes after the equal sign. This expression will:

    {&bsol;&bsol;=}{[0-9]+}

This expression works just like the previous one. All we have now are two tagged sub-expressions that can be located with the &bsol;&bsol;n syntax. The corresponding replace expression is therefore:

    &bsol;&bsol;1&quot;&bsol;&bsol;2&quot;

This says, &quot;Insert a quote after the first set of tagged text characters and another quote after the second set of tagged text characters.&quot;
