I feel obliged to apologize before I do this: sorry. Associating VB with Java is pretty nasty. Okay:

VB is all about encapsulating procedures; Java is all about encapsulating data.

VB (as of 6.0) has modules; Java has classes. Java's equivalent of a standard module is to have a class containing the main() method. And, yes, VB has the &quot;class module.&quot;

VB has module-level variables; Java has instance fields.

VB has optional parameters; Java has overloading.
