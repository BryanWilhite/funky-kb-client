This is equal to expending approximately 150 calories of energy per day or 1,000 calories per week. The following are activities with the approximate time needed to fulfill the 150-calorie requirement:  

* Washing and waxing a car for 45-60 minutes 
* Playing volleyball for 45 minutes 
* Gardening for 30-45 minutes
