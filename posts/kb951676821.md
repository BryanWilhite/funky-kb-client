Potassium is a mineral that's essential for growth and general good 
health. As a necessary component in the body, potassium keeps normal water balance between cells and body fluids, maintains normal blood pressure, transmits nerve impulses, and helps muscles to contract. Potassium has also been found to lower blood pressure and even decrease your risk for cancer. 

You can find potassium in a variety of foods, including fruits and 
vegetables, dairy products, and meat. Although there is no recommended daily allowance for potassium, the minimum amount for adults is 3,500 milligrams per day. Sometimes, potassium deficiencies warrant potassium supplements, especially under the following conditions: 

* starvation dieting 

* prolonged vomiting or diarrhea 

* laxative abuse 

* kidney problems 

 
Salt is a good supplemental source of potassium. In fact, only one teaspoon of salt contains 1,500 milligrams of potassium. Better yet, salt substitutes contain a whopping 2,800 milligrams of potassium per teaspoon.
