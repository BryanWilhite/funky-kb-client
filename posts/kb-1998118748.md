Lutein is a relative of vitamin A. It has gained attention for its ability to prevent progression of macular degeneration, a leading cause of vision loss in the elderly. The Journal of American Medical Association reports that people consuming lutein-rich foods such as spinach and collard greens had lower risks of macular degeneration. Lutein is deposited in the macula, which is the central part of the eye's retina and is responsible for vision detail and filtering out harmful light rays. Lutein is available as a supplement at health food stores.
