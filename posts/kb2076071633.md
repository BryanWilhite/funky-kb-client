A run is an arbitrary sequence of characters in an Office System Word 2003 document. In Visual Basic for Applications for Word, this would probably be called a Range. The run element, &lt;r /&gt; is documented here:

    http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/
        WordXMLCDK/html/cdkweler_simpleFieldType_HV01114797.asp

The run property child element, &lt;rPr /&gt; , of the run element is designed to deal with the problem of &quot;multiple formatting&quot;---say, applying bold and italic to characters.
