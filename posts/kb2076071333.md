The need to follow the rules of Normalization break down in the context of DBMS performance and analytical processing. For details on the subject of Denormailization please see &quot;BENEFITS OF DENORMALIZED RELATIONAL DATABASE TABLES&quot; at:

Microsoft uses Denormalization when its OLAP technology in SQL 7.x uses &quot;pre-complied aggregations&quot; which are stored in a multidemenional cache called a &quot;cube.&quot; For more details please see &quot;OLAP Services: Optimizing Cube Performance Using Microsoft OLAP Services&quot; at:
