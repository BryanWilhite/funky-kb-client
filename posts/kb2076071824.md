The xsl:include include element needs no special security procedure associated with it. It should behave as expected when an XSLT file is including another file on the same server---especially one in the same application domain.

'No special security procedure' essentially means using XslTransform.Load() to load an XSLT file without providing a XmlUrlResolver as a parameter. According to the MSDN documentation, &quot;For overloads of XslTransform.Load() that do not take a resolver parameter, a default XmlUrlResolver with no credentials is created for the user by XslTransform.&quot; More information is here:
