SharePoint uses the BLOB data type in SQL Server to store files. SharePoint is the primordial ancestor of WinFS. It is tempting to see it as a full replacement for a traditional file system like NTFS. But there are limitations explored in “SharePoint vs. File Shares” here:

* “Long Paths—WebDav has a limit of 260 chars, and so does MOSS/WSS [or less].”

* “Weird files with inter-file references—the most common problem here includes Excel spreadsheets that are typically peppered with references to data stored in other excel files…”

* “Weird file names—Infrequently users will have filenames that are like test...txt or test#%.txt as a requirement of some application, or as part of a file naming standard.”

According to “Is the File Server Dead?” by Joel Oleson, these are valid uses of the File System over SharePoint:

* Product Distribution (Product packages like Office)
* SMS distribution point (desktop patches and hot fixes)
* NT Backups, Backup Servers and Desktop Backups
* Database Storage
* Large Audio/Video and Streaming Media and other large archive read only media such as DVDs, CDs storage (.iso, .wmv, .ram, .vhd)
* Developer Source Control
* Batch, Command Scripts, Executables (.exe, .vbs, .cmd, .bat)
* Application Server... Client Application Storage Linked Files and File Dependencies -  (.lnk, .lck)
* Archives and Dumps (.arj, .rar, .zip, .dmp, .bak)
