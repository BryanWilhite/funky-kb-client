Using Alt-key combinations for the Tab Control may not work all the time in Access 97. What I have noticed is when the access keys are pressed, the focus does not change but the application &quot;beeps.&quot; This problem is intermittent. It appears to work correctly for tabs with fewer controls on them (three controls or less perhaps).

One work-around for this problem is responding to the KeyDown event:

    Private Sub Form_KeyDown(KeyCode As Integer, _
        Shift As Integer)

        Dim blnAltDwn As Boolean
        blnAltDwn = (Shift And acAltMask) &gt; 0
    
        With Me
            If blnAltDwn And KeyCode = vbKeyD Then
                'Tab Caption: &quot;Import Ownership &Data&quot;
                .pagImport.SetFocus
            ElseIf blnAltDwn And KeyCode = vbKeyG Then
                'Tab Caption: &quot;Build/Edit Ownership &Groups&quot;
                .pagGrouping.SetFocus
            ElseIf blnAltDwn And KeyCode = vbKeyP Then
                'Tab Caption: &quot;Build Ownership Re&port&quot;
                .pagRpt.SetFocus
            End If
        End With
    End Sub

Using this code, the beeps eventually stop while the Alt-key combinations are pressed.

MSKB Article Q156222 (&quot;ACC95: Access Keys Do Not Work with Tabs on TabStrip Control&quot;) states &quot;Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access 7.0. This problem no longer occurs in Microsoft Access 97.&quot;
