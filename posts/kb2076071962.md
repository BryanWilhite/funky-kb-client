An attempt was made to mount a cygwin drive with sshfs and fuse. It did NOT work. Following the article “How to Mount a Remote Folder using SSH on Ubuntu” here:

    http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/ubuntu/
        how-to-mount-a-remote-folder-using-ssh-on-ubuntu/

these steps were taken:

    sudo apt-get install sshfs

    sudo modprobe fuse

    sudo adduser &lt;username&gt; fuse

    sudo chown root:fuse /dev/fuse

    sudo chmod +x /dev/fuse

    mkdir ~/remoteserv

At this step many sshfs commands were tried. None worked:

    sshfs &lt;username&gt;@&lt;ipaddress&gt;:/remotepath ~/remoteserv
or
    sudo sshfs &lt;username&gt;@&lt;ipaddress&gt;:/remotepath ~/remoteserv
or
     sshfs &lt;username&gt;@&lt;ipaddress&gt;:/cygdrive/c/remotepath ~/remoteserv -o allow_other -p 22

All of these attempts produced this error:

    failed to access mountpoint /home/&lt;username&gt;/remoteserv: Permission denied
