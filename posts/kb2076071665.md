Lesson 2: Using Validation

The purpose of this lesson is to detail the validation controls in ASP.NET.

* &quot;Client-side validation is provided by a JScript library named WebUIValidation.js, which is downloaded separately to the client.&quot;

It is important to note that the client-side validation features in ASP.NET work only in Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4.0 and later. This is why validation controls automatically provide server-side validation. (Incidentally, the sample Web form Validation1.aspx uses a call to Server.Transfer() that breaks the automatic server-side validation functionality.)

The validation controls: RequiredFieldValidator, CompareValidator, RangeValidator, RegularExpressionValidator, CustomValidator and ValidationSummary.

* &quot;A server control can have multiple validators.&quot;

The lesson details a problem (in Table 4-7) with the CompareValidator control that can be solved by combining it with a RequiredFieldValidator control.

* &quot;To let the user cancel validation, provide a Submit HTML control that sets the Page_ValidationActive attribute...&quot;

Clicking on this Submit HTML control will cause a postback and in the Page_Load event procedure below, the variable bln will be false:

    bool bln;
    if(this.IsPostBack)
    {
        this.Validate();
        bln = this.IsValid;
    }

There is a typo in this lesson stating effectively that bln would be true.

* &quot;Customizing Validation... On the server side, place your validation code in the ServerValidate event procedure... To provide client-side validation, specify a validation script in the CustomValidator control's ClientValidationFunction property.&quot;

This may be one of very few places where an external JavaScript file could seamlessly integrate with an ASP.NET Web form design pattern.
