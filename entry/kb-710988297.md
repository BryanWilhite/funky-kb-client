By editing the Registry, you can make an X-Window-like Mouse Pointer that will get the focus of any window under its &quot;pointing pixel.&quot; The following Registry Key must be Merged from a properly formatted *.REG file:

    HKEY_CURRENT_USER
        &bsol;&bsol;Control Panel&bsol;&bsol;Mouse            &quot;ActiveWindowTracking&quot;=&quot;1&quot;

Secondly, you can &quot;snap&quot; your mouse pointer to the default button when a dialog appears. The following Registry Key must be Merged from a properly formatted *.REG file:

    HKEY_CURRENT_USER
        &bsol;&bsol;Control Panel&bsol;&bsol;Mouse            &quot;SnapToDefaultButton&quot;=&quot;1&quot;

The current user should log off and log on before these changes take effect. As of this writing, Microsoft has a complete discussion of this topic at:
