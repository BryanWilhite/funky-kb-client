At this time in my life, I find it convenient to debug my ASP pages directly in the web browser window. This probably comes from my &quot;traditional&quot; building of ASP pages with only a text editor. I am sure I am missing out on the code breaking features of Visual InterDev. But for now, when I want to see the contents of a variable (e.g. vReturn), I would use the following lines of code:

    Response. Write &quot;My Variable: &quot; & vReturn
    Response.End

These lines are placed in the same manner that VB's Stop statement was heavily used in the &quot;old days.&quot; And they should be feared in the same way as well!

Another more subtle technique is to Write HTML comments with the form:

    Response. Write &quot;&lt;!-- My Variable: &quot; & vReturn & &quot;--&gt;&quot;
