Gas and bloating are normal occurrences as the body digests and absorbs food. Gas is produced in the small intestine when fat is ingested. Gas may also be produced in the colon when carbohydrates that aren't fully digested begin to ferment. Normally, most gas is absorbed as food travels through the digestive tract. 

Fruits contain fructose, a form of carbohydrate that some people cannot fully digest. Fructose enters the colon, where it begins to ferment. As a result, gas is produced. Fruits that contain sorbitol, a natural sugar alcohol, produce more gas than fruits without it. Fruits that contain both fructose and sorbitol include apples, pears, 
cherries, prunes, and peaches.
