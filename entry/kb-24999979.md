Vienna 2.0 supports stereo sound samples by using the mono 16-bit CD quality samples required in previous versions. When a stereo sound file is imported, it is split into its left and right channels in two separate files. A stereo effect can be achieved by using more than one zone under an Instrument. Each zone can be panned and delayed to make some interesting stereo effects.
