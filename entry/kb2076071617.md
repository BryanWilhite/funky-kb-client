The assumption here is that, during Microsoft's reactionary quest to address security flaws, someone broke EVENTLOG.DLL. I suspect that my event logs began to disappear after an automatic update from Windows Update. Some guy named Matt posted this on bmonday(dot)com:

&quot;I had this problem and it only reared its ugly head when I changed the log files to 'Overwrite as needed' because I got fed up of deleting them. So this supports your theory.&quot;

So what I did was set all of my logs to Properties &gt; General &gt; Log size &gt; Do not overwrite events (clear log manually). Microsoft recognizes this problem in MSKB article 829246 (&quot;Event logs are corrupted&quot;) here:
