If you're a rice lover, you'll be relieved to know that rice is 
naturally low in fat. In fact, a cup of plain, steamed rice provides a mere 200 calories and less than two grams of fat. Unfortunately, most of us often prefer our rice dish with a little added flavor, which means added fat. 

As you add butter, margarine, or vegetable oil to rice to cook or 
saute it, that fat content can really begin to climb. Only one 
teaspoon of butter, margarine, or vegetable oil adds nine to 12 grams of extra fat and an additional 100 calories! Yes, one cup of tasty Chinese fried rice equates to about 370 calories and a whopping 12 grams of fat! 

To still get a flavorful helping of tasty rice without a lot of the 
added calories and fat, try these ideas: 
 - Mix cooked rice with equal amounts of sauteed veggies, such as 
carrots, onions, broccoli, or zucchini, cooked in olive oil. 
- Combine a serving of fried rice with a heaping amount of steamed 
vegetables.
