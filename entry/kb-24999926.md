The &quot;Object server not correctly registered&quot; message appears after Tools &gt; Custom Controls... is selected when one of the .OCX files in the Windows&bsol;&bsol;System directory corresponding to the control listed in the Custom Controls dialog is not present. To stop the message from appearing delete the &quot;appropriate&quot; registry entry. Of course deleting a CLSID key is risky so be careful! A relatively safer option is to run Microsoft Regclean. It is in the &bsol;&bsol;Tools&bsol;&bsol;Pss directory of the VB4 Standard Edition CD-ROM. Make sure to restart the system immediately after using it.
