Studies suggest that eating soy foods regularly can prevent serious 
diseases like breast, colon, and prostate cancer, heart disease, and 
osteoporosis. Soy has long been known as a healthy food. It's an 
excellent source of fiber and is low in saturated fat. Soy can be a 
healthy addition to any diet or a substitute for meat. 

By adding one serving of soy foods to your diet, you start reaping all 
the benefits soy has to offer. Following are some easy ways to get soy 
into your diet: 

* Soy milk: use in cereal, shakes, baked goods, or pancakes. 

* Tofu: use as a sour cream substitute in salad dressings or dips. 
You can also use tofu in soups and salads. 

* Soy flour: use in baking, but if you need something to rise, mix 
the soy flour with wheat flour.
