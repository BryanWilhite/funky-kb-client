Sometimes is is better to DROP a table instead of using the ALTER TABLE or sp_rename commands. If the table has data in it, use the SELECT INTO syntax to create a temporary table. For example:

    SELECT *
    INTO tmpTable
    FROM MyTable

when the table (&quot;MyTable&quot;) is ready to have its data back use the INSERT statement. Following our example we have:

    INSERT MyTable (Col1, Col2, Col3)
    SELECT (Col1, Col2, Col3)
    FROM tmpTable

Column lists are used here as omitting column lists may not be supported on all servers. Once the table (&quot;MyTable&quot;) gets its data back, we would then DROP &quot;tmpTable.&quot;
