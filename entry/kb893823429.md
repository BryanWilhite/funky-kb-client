WINNT.BMP and WINNT256.BMP are located in the folder assigned to %SystemRoot%. To change the default startup logo, change these files. The pixel dimensions of the file is limited by the resolution of the display.

To see any changes to the startup logo, restart the system. Logging on as &quot;another user&quot; does not guarantee a change to the logo.
