Both DIV and SPAN are &quot;Generic Containers&quot; as they do not apply any visible formatting without the use of the CLASS attribute and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). The difference between DIV and SPAN is that the former is a block-level element and the latter is an in-line element.

The use of DIV and SPAN with CSS is quite successful with many web browsers. Using SPAN---and especially DIV---with client-side scripting is not very successful with many web browsers at this proprietary moment in time.
