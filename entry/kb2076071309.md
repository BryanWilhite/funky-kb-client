The SQL 7 Tables sysxlogins and sysservers can be opened to remove users and/or servers that you do not want to appear in dialogs in the Enterprise Manager. By opening the SQL Server Properties &gt; Server Settings dialog in the Enterprise Manager you can make sure that you can modify these tables by checking &quot;Allow modifications to be made directly to the system catalogs&quot;.
