2.1.2 Renderers

&quot;When components render themselves, it's called the direct implementation model, but JSF also supports the delegated implementation model...&quot; The classes that implement these implementation models are called &quot;renderers.&quot; All of the standard JSF components use the delegated implementation model.

&quot;Renderers are organized into render kits... JSF ships with a standard render kit for HTML 4.01...&quot;

It is important to understand that renderers implement encoding and decoding for the response and the request, respectively. &quot;Because all encoding and encoding is handled by a single entity... the visual representation of the component and the underlying protocol for translating between request parameters and objects on the server are nicely self-contained.&quot;

It follows that the ability to change a render kit means that &quot;displaying a different markup language is just a matter of changing the render kit.&quot;


2.1.3 Validators

&quot;Faces handles validation in three ways---at the UI component level [declaratively], via validator methods in backing beans, or in validator classes.&quot;

Here is an example of declarative validation:

    &lt;h:inputText&gt;
        &lt;f:validateLength minimum=&quot;2&quot; maximum=&quot;10&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/h:inputText&gt;
