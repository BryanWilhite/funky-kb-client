Lesson 1: Building a Web Application

This lesson quickly introduces the concepts of the meta-data associated with .NET assemblies and the configuration of automatic assembly compilation with &quot;build options.&quot;

* &quot;Web applications have two build options: debug and release.&quot;

It may be better to remind us that Visual Studio solutions have two, default, build options: Debug and Release. Other configurations can be added. For more, see &quot;Default and Custom Builds&quot; at:

    http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/
        vsintro7/html/vxconprojectbuilds.asp

Project-level build options in the Property Pages dialog can be set for additional control over the build process.

* &quot;The application's build option and Web.config setting should agree. There is no advantage in having one set to debug and the other set to release...&quot;

* &quot;To identify your application, open the AssemblyInfo file and enter the application's information in the assembly attributes.&quot;

These declarative attributes should not be confused with similar procedural properties in the System.Windows.Forms.Application class.
