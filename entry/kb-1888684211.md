The general form for the file protocol in the Windows environments is:

    file:///&lt;drive letter&gt;|&lt;path&gt;

where &lt;path&gt; mimics the Unix-like forward slash ('/') format. So if you are trying to use the Active Desktop with a custom home page that points to local folders on your hard drive, this protocol suddenly becomes useful. This format also works on Netscape browsers in Windows.

For example, to link to a folder called &quot;foo&quot; on drive &quot;C:&quot; we have:

    file:///C|/foo
