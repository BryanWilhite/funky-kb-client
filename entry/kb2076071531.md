The following shortcut keys are available from a Terminal Services Client: 

CTRL+ALT+END opens the Windows Security dialog box.

ALT+PAGE UP switches between programs from left to right.

ALT+PAGE DOWN switches between programs from right to left.

ALT+INSERT cycles through the programs in the order they were started.

ALT+HOME displays the Start menu.

CTRL+ALT+BREAK switches the client between a window (if applicable) and a full screen.

ALT+DELETE displays the window's pop-up menu.

CTRL+ALT+Minus (-) symbol on the numeric keypad places a snapshot of the active window, within the client, on the Terminal server clipboard (provides the same functionality as pressing ALT+PrintScrn on a local computer.) 

CTRL+ALT+Plus (+) symbol on the numeric keypad places a snapshot of the entire client window area on the Terminal server clipboard (provides the same functionality as pressing PrintScrn on a local computer.)
