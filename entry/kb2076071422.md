According to its KB article, Microsoft places caching (in the pre-.NET world) in the three contexts: the browser (client), the web server and the proxy server. The code appears with respect to these contexts as HTML:

    &lt;META HTTP-EQUIV=&quot;PRAGMA CONTENT=&quot;NO-CACHE&quot;&gt;

as IIS ASP:

    &lt;% Response.Expires = 0 %&gt;

and as Proxy Server ASP:

    &lt;% Response.cachecontrol= &quot;public&quot; %&gt;
