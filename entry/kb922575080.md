When you are certain that your DLLs for your reference are installed (because, perhaps, you properly used REGSVR32.EXE) but they still show up as &quot;MISSING...&quot; in Project &gt; References... list, try editing the .VBP file associated with the project. 

Close the project (to be safe, close Visual Basic). Open the .VBP file in a text editor. Remove the lines that begin with &quot;Reference=*...&quot; referring to the missing References. Reopen the project file in Visual Basic. Choose Project &gt; References... to select the components that you know are installed.
