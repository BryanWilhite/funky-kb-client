The main idea behind incorporating XML into ASP solutions (besides vacuous fashion trends labeled &quot;cool&quot;) is to reduce dependency on Microsoft-specific components (while simultaneously being vendor-compliant). In keeping with this realistic goal, the first Microsoft-specific target is the ADO Recordset. The second major target is the use of ASP scripting languages to render HTML.

First target: the ADO Recordset. Replace the ADO Recordset with the ADO Stream in ADO 2.5 and above:

Second target: use XML/XSL to render HTML. This is based on the Microsoft.XMLDOM object.
