If no CD-ROM drive is detected in Windows 3.1, check to see if the setting is changed to &quot;0,&quot; in MPLAYER.INI. If the setting has changed, then set it to &quot;17.&quot; This setting can change when the operating system checks for a CD-ROM drive during a WinSetup driver installation or when the SYSTEM.INI is updated.
