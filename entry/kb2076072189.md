The leaves are commonly used as a leaf vegetable throughout the area of mainland African distribution, including Malawi, Zimbabwe, and the Sahel. They are eaten both fresh and as a dry powder. In Nigeria, the leaves are locally known as kuka, and are used to make kuka soup. The fruit is nutritious possibly having more vitamin C than oranges and exceeding the calcium content of cow's milk.
