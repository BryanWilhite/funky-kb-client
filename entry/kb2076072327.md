The Ctrl+E keyboard shortcut is the Paste to New command. This suggests that the Ctrl+C, Ctrl+E keys combination can be used to quickly break up a large sound file into smaller ones.

When regions are defined in the large sound file the Regions List (Alt+2) can be used with the Ctrl+C, Ctrl+E keys combination for even faster keyboard-based editing.
