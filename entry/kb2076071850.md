Use the System Configuration Utility (msconfig.exe) to stop Adobe Photo Downloader (apdproxy.exe) from loading. Uncheck the box next to apdproxy.exe under Startup &gt; Startup Item. This will cause Windows to switch into Selective Startup mode and the next time you reboot a message to this effect will be displayed. You should be able to disable this message.

Additionally, you can use Tweak UI to remove Adobe Photoshop Album Starter Edition as an AutoPlay handler under My Computer &gt; AutoPlay &gt; Handlers.

Adobe Photo Downloader may appear again in the System Notification Area when the ‘relevant’ Adobe product is launched.
