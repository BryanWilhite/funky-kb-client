In order for the following sub-routine to work, a custom menu must be assigned to the form with the DoMenuItem action Size Window to Fit Form.

Sub Form_Load ()
    '
    'Among other things, this event uses the custom menu
    'to size the Window via old-fashioned SendKeys crap.
    '
    SendKeys &quot;%MW&quot;
End Sub

NOTE: In Access 97, there is the acCmdSizeToFitForm parameter of the RunCommand method of the DoCmd object.
