It's easy to sort a list of strings or integers by just calling the List.Sort() method, but how can we sort two objects and based on what field?

…

Let's implement IComparable&lt;&gt; interface to our Employee class:

class Employee : IComparable&lt;Employee&gt;
{
     public string Name { get; set; }
     public int Salary { get; set; }
        
     #region IComparable&lt;Employee&gt; Members
       
     public int CompareTo( Employee other )
     {
         if ( this.Salary &lt; other.Salary ) return 1;
         else if ( this.Salary &gt; other.Salary ) return -1;
         else return 0;
     }
        
     #endregion
}

In the above code, we are sorting objects based on salary of employee in descending order, by implementing CompareTo() method of IComparable interface which takes Employee reference as a parameter.
Now, calling empList.Sort() gives no exception and empList is well sorted by salary.

But sometimes, we may need to sort a list of objects when class does not implement IComparable&lt;&gt; interface and also we may need various kinds of sorting on that class like:

   1. Sort Employees by Salary in Ascending Order
   2. Sort Employees by Salary in Descending Order
   3. Sort Employees by Name

To solve this problem, .NET provides a special interface called IComparer&lt;&gt; which has a method Compare(), takes two object parameters X, Y and returns an int.
Use of IComparer&lt;&gt; interface tells List how exactly you want to sort.

class Employee_SortBySalaryByAscendingOrder : IComparer&lt;Employee&gt;
{
    #region IComparer&lt;Employee&gt; Members
    
    public int Compare( Employee x, Employee y )
    {
        if ( x.Salary &gt; y.Salary ) return 1;
        else if ( x.Salary &lt; y.Salary ) return -1;
        else return 0;
    }
    
    #endregion
}

class Employee_SortBySalaryByDescendingOrder : IComparer&lt;Employee&gt;
{
    #region IComparer&lt;Employee&gt; Members
    
    public int Compare( Employee x, Employee y )
    {
        if ( x.Salary &lt; y.Salary ) return 1;
        else if ( x.Salary &gt; y.Salary ) return -1;
        else return 0;
    }
    
    #endregion
}

class Employee_SortByName : IComparer&lt;Employee&gt;
{
    #region IComparer&lt;Employee&gt; Members
    
    public int Compare( Employee x, Employee y )
    {
        return string.Compare( x.Name, y.Name );
    }
    
    #endregion
}

The above code introduces three classes by implementing Compare() method of IComparer interface.

Now, how do we use this? We just have to pass the reference of these classes as a object parameter to Sort() method as shown below:

// Use Collection Initializers( C# 3.0 ) to initialize the List 
List&lt;Employee&gt; empList = new List&lt;Employee&gt;() 
		{ new Employee { Name = &quot;a&quot;, Salary = 14000 },
                    new Employee { Name = &quot;b&quot;, Salary = 13000 } 
                  };
                                     
Employee_SortBySalaryByAscendingOrder eAsc = 
		new Employee_SortBySalaryByAscendingOrder(); 
// Sort Employees by salary by ascending order.   
empList.Sort( eAsc );
    
Employee_SortBySalaryByDescendingOrder eDsc = 
		new Employee_SortBySalaryByDescendingOrder();
// Sort Employees by salary by descending order. 
empList.Sort( eDsc );
    
Employee_SortByName eName = new Employee_SortByName();
// Sort Employees by their names.                                 
empList.Sort( eName );

Conclusion

Sorting Lists is simple as long as you sort basic elements like strings and integers for which comparison classes are defined.

Usage of IComparable&lt;&gt; and IComparer&lt;&gt; interface helps to sort Lists of objects on custom classes easily.
