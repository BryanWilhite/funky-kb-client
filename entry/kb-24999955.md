Trying to cut and paste text into pine causes Netcom's server to suspend the connection and even send e-mail with accusations of multiple logins! To avoid this, paste text into a pico editing session and save a file. Then run pine and type Ctrl-R to read in this file. This pico session technique is especially useful for the .addressbook file.
