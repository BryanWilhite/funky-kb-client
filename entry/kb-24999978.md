Since AWE Control Panel Effects (like Room 3 and Plate) are global effects they are not useful when you only want one or two tracks to have Panning Delay. A solution would be to record that particular instrument with the Control Panel effect (using a WAV file recorder) and then load it in a SF2 sound bank. Level 2 Sound Fonts support stereo samples.
