I can only see using an Asynchronous connection when implementing ADO for a desktop solution. For a stateless IIS Application there is no waiting. It seems very linear to me: get in and get out. For more information regarding this matter please see MS KB articles Q190991 (&quot;HOWTO: Trap for ADO Connection Errors Using WithEvents&quot;) and Q194960 (&quot;HOWTO: Create an Asynchronous Connection in ADO&quot;).
