The primary purpose of badgerports is to provide recent versions of the Mono framework, and associated packages such as F-Spot, Banshee, and Monodevelop. Suggestions for other packages to include are welcome, but don't be offended if I decline for whatever reason.
How do I use badgerports?

First, download a copy of the archive's GPG key from here [http://directhex.mfgames.com/directhex.ppa.asc], or obtain it yourself (key ID 0E1FAD0C).

Next, launch Software Sources (System, Administration, Software Sources) and navigate to the Authentication tab. Click &quot;Import Key File&quot; and select the key file from earlier.

Click on the &quot;Third Party Software&quot; tab, click &quot;Add&quot;, type the following line, then click &quot;OK&quot;:

deb http://directhex.mfgames.com/ hardy main

Now, click the &quot;Close&quot; button to enable all badgerports packages.
