The following error message may occur after selecting Tools &gt; Replication &gt; Create Replica...: &quot;Microsoft Access can't convert the database to a Design Master. Cannot make the MSysCmdBars object in Tables container replicable.&quot; This problem is most likely due to a version of replication dynamic-link library, MSREPL35.DLL, less than 3.51.0623.0.

To obtain updated DLLs from Microsoft please refer to the following Microsoft Knowledge Base articles: &quot;ACC97: Updated Version of Microsoft Jet 3.5 Available on MSL&quot; (Q172733); &quot;ACC97: Error Converting Database To Design Master&quot; (Q173775).
