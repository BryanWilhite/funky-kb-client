The general form for entering Explorer commands from the console is 

    Explorer [/n][/e][,/root,&lt;path or UNC&gt;][[,/select],&lt;object&gt;] 

where:

/n opens Explorer with object view only;

/e opens Explorer with tree view and object view at the current folder;

/root,&lt;path or UNC&gt; opens Explorer at the specified root level;

/select,&lt;object&gt; specifies which object (a file, folder or volume) gets the focus. The select parameter may not work in certain IE4 installations.

Some &quot;stupid&quot; Explorer tricks:

    Explorer ..

will open Explorer one directory above the current directory.

    Explorer 
will open Explorer at the root directory (usally C:&bsol;&bsol;).

Note that most of these commands also apply to Shortcuts and the Run dialog as well. One Explorer command that works only in the Run dialog consists of a single period (&quot;.&quot;). The &quot;period command&quot; is the same as Explorer &bsol;&bsol;.
