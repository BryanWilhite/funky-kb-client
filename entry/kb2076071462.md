Dimension Guidelines

Currently, size standards for banner ads are really just recommendations. Two professional associations, the Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB) and the Coalition for Advertising-Supported Information and Entertainment (CASIE), have compiled a list of the most popular and most effective banner ad sizes. According to IAB's Web site, a joint committee of IAB and CASIE members &quot;has identified the following as the most commonly accepted&quot;:

Type: Dimensions (in pixels): 
Full banner 468 x 60 
Full banner w/ vertical navigation Bar    392 x 72 
Half banner 234 x 60 
Square button 125 x 125 
Button 1 120 x 90 
Button 2 120 x 60 
Micro button 88 x 31 
Vertical banner 120 x 240
