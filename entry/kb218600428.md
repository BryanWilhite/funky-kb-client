Foods with a high water content can play an important role in keeping your fluid levels up, which can help reduce fatigue and improve your physical performance and overall health. 

Along with that bottle of water you keep in your backpack or the cup of water you sip at your desk, add some of these water-rich foods to your daily meals and snacks: lettuce, watermelon, grapes, cantaloupe, honeydew, oranges, tangerines, grapefruit, apples, pears, peaches, plums, jicama, broccoli, carrots, fruit and vegetable juices, cucumbers, celery, and radishes. 

Even foods that aren't obviously juicy can provide your body with 
needed liquids. Baked potatoes, canned tuna, cooked pasta, rice, 
beans, and even lean roasted chicken and beef are more than 50 percent water by weight.
