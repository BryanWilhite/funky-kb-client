Blankman: Since a WCF service can return any user defined class, why use a DataContract and CompositeType class?

I can return something like:

[OperationContract]
MyUserCollection GetUsers();

What am I missing?

Guy Starbuck: The DataContract is just a formal definition of a type that can be understood on both sides of the service boundary.

If you return, as in your example, a &quot;MyUserCollection&quot; object, the consumers of your service will need to reference the innards of your service/system, which is a violation of the SOA tenet of explicit boundaries. By using a DataContract, you are publishing the structure of your return types in a loosely-coupled way.
