You can clean your recent workspaces list in eclipse for the Select a Workspace dialog by editing a text file called org.eclipse.ui.ide.prefs in your eclipse installation folder at this relative path (in Linux):

    configuration/.settings

Edit the RECENT_WORKSPACES= line knowing that the Workspace paths are delimited by the Java newline character (&bsol;&bsol;n).
