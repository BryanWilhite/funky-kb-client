Evidently, Pose, Material, Light and Camera presets (saved in DSB files) can be merged with a scene with the File &gt; Merge... command.

DSB files can be loaded in the Content pane (under Edit &gt; Preferences... &gt; Directories &gt; DAZ|Studio Content Directories &gt; Add...) but this merge command is an alternative.

For Pose presets, remember to select the object in the scene first before saving/applying the Preset. Otherwise nothing will happen. The relevant error messages have not been implemented yet!

There is no official DAZ documentation seen by me yet on this topic.
