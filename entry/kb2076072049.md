Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 Tools Visual Studio 2008 Extensions, Version 1.2 requires WSS. This may seem obvious or a future version for Visual Studio will have ‘disconnected’ Setup option.

These were installed:

* Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 with Service Pack 1-x86

* Infrastructure Update for Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 (KB951695)-x86

* Microsoft SharePoint Administration Toolkit v2.0 x86

The non-Farm (default) install will make a “SharePoint - 80” Web Application that will take over any preexisting IIS site on port 80. The old site will be stopped and its files untouched.

The default install will generate a SQL Embedded database with this Named Pipe connection:

    np:&bsol;&bsol;&bsol;&bsol;.&bsol;&bsol;pipe&bsol;&bsol;MSSQL$Microsoft##SSEE&bsol;&bsol;sql&bsol;&bsol;query

This is stored at this location:

    %SystemRoot%&bsol;&bsol;SYSMSI&bsol;&bsol;SSEE&bsol;&bsol;MSSQL.2005&bsol;&bsol;MSSQL&bsol;&bsol;DATA

This (again) might be obvious but SharePoint stores documents as binary BLOBs in a content database. Sheetal Jain explores this in “SharePoint and Large files ( &gt; 1GB) in a Document Library?” here:
