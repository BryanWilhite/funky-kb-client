This work is a summary of the 16 years of research and field studies which were intended for a 2-volume history of the African people. The writing plan for the two volumes would have required at least another five years, even if the serious impairment of my vision had not occurred.

…

The Destruction of Black Civilization, therefore, could not wait another five years just to be more detailed, impressive, or massive in scope …and so written that black John Doe, cab driver or laborer, and Jane Doe, housemaid or waitress, as well as college students and professors, could read and understand the message from their forefathers and foremothers.
