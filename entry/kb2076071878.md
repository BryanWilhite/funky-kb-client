You can start with this command:

    :help gui-init

This will load gui.txt, which should reveal a portion called “Recommended place for your personal GUI initializations”—this will lead to this file:

    $HOME/.gvimrc

Here is a sample .gvimrc file:

    colorscheme darkblue
    set expandtab
    set guifont=Monospace&bsol;&bsol; 20
    set hlsearch
    set incsearch
    set laststatus=2
    set number
    set shiftwidth=4
    set tabstop=4
    set tbis=large

Options like tbis and guifont can be found in quickref.txt, which can be loaded with this command:

    :help option-list
