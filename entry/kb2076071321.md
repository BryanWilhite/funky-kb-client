The wider the variety of foods you eat, the more likely you are to get all the nutrients you need for good health. There are five foods you should eat every day because of their nutritional qualities and direct link to disease prevention. These foods are: 

1. Oranges: a good source of folic acid, fiber, beta-carotene, and vitamin C; enjoy oranges in a variety of ways---for instance, as a juice or in a fruit salad.

2. Dark, leafy vegetables: loaded with anti-cancer compounds and nutrients, beta-carotene, vitamin C, and fiber.

3. Bran cereal: prevents constipation, helps fight breast cancer by lowering estrogen supplies; can use bran cereal in muffins and casseroles. 

4. Yogurt: excellent source of calcium; boosts the immune system and helps prevent yeast infections.

5. Soy: helps relieve hot flashes; fights osteoporosis in post-menopausal women.
