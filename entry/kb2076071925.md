SELECT

FROM
    @xml.nodes('//Root/*') AS Temp(Items)

/*
    The SELECT form avoids an error like:

    “The column 'Items' that was returned
    from the nodes() method cannot be used directly.
    It can only be used with one
    of the four xml data type methods,
    exist(), nodes(), query(), and value(),
    or in IS NULL and IS NOT NULL checks.”

    The table alias (with columns) avoids this error:

    “The table (and its columns) returned
    by a table-valued method need to be aliased.”

    These two errors imply that:

         * The nodes() method returns a table.
         * The table returned from the nodes() has XML columns.

    It follows that one may never persist a table with XML columns
    but temporary XML columns are very likely to be used.
