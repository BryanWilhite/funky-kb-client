In Windows 95 or Windows NT, the MIDI Mapper and the Sound Mapper interfaces have been rolled into the Multimedia Control Panel Applet. Sound Mapper controls are under the Audio tab. MIDI Mapper controls are under the MIDI tab.

Microsoft may have changed the marketing meaning of &quot;Sound Mapper&quot;; its documentation may imply that the Sounds Control Panel Applet of Windows 95/NT replaces the Sound Mapper. In this context, this information is misleading.
