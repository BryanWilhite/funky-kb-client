The yield keyword is used only inside of a for loop and with an IEnumerable&lt;&gt; generic type to form a pattern like this:

    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; integers = Program.YieldList( 1, 10, 2 );
        }

        public static IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; YieldList( int start,
            int end, int increment )
        {
            for (int current = start;
                current &lt;= end; current += increment)
            {
                yield return current;
            }
        }
    }

The variable current is the same type as that specified in IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; and the yield keyword fills IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; until the loop is finished. Without yield, the loop would return after one pass (actually the code won’t compile!).

As elegant as this pattern appears, note that, as of this writing, setting a breakpoint inside of YieldList() and getting the Debugger to stop on it is “problematic” (just not possible). Targeting .NET 3.5 from Visual Studio 2008 provides a debugging visualizer for IEnumerable&lt;&gt;.
