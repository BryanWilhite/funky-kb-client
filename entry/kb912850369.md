The following Registry Keys must be Merged from a properly formatted *.REG file:

    HKEY_USERS
        &bsol;&bsol;.DEFAULT&bsol;&bsol;Control Panel&bsol;&bsol;Keyboard
            &quot;InitialKeyboardIndicators&quot;=&quot;2&quot;

    HKEY_CURRENT_USER
        &bsol;&bsol;Control Panel&bsol;&bsol;Keyboard
            &quot;InitialKeyboardIndicators&quot;=&quot;2&quot; 

Note that InitialKeyboardIndicators is of type REG_SZ (string). It has been said that this procedure may not work as planned. The opinion here is that this setting does not force an &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot; state. I assume that it is saving the state that the Numlock Key is in before the user logs off.
