If your design demands passing dates in an HTTP Query String, you will quickly find that this is a badly formed URI:

    http://localhost/MyPage.html?vDate=#01/02/1999#

where the &quot;#&quot; characters imply that this is a date to be submitted to an .MDB file. You might be able to get by with this:

    http://localhost/MyPage.html?vDate=X01-02-1999X

where &quot;X&quot; is some dummy replacement character. But I find this unattractive. Instead of coming up with my own unattractive replacement characters, the ASP Server object has its URLEncode method, where:

    &quot;http://localhost/MyPage.html?&quot; _
        & &quot;vDate=&quot; & Server.URLEncode(&quot;#01/02/1999#&quot;)

yields

    http://localhost/MyPage.html?vDate=%2301%2F02%2F1999%23

Strangely, I would rather convert the date to its underlying numerical format. The following returns the number 36162:

    CDbl(DateSerial(1999,01,02))

which may lead to the question, How can I easily parse the year, month and day out of a &quot;date string&quot;? The answer is to use the Year, Month and Day functions respectively:

    CDbl(DateSerial(Year(&quot;01/02/1999&quot;), _
        Month(&quot;01/02/1999&quot;), _
        Day(&quot;01/02/1999&quot;)))

After conversion, the URI now looks like the following:

    http://localhost/MyPage.html?vDate=36162

Of course, to convert a serial date double back to its locale value requires the CDate() function:

    CDate(36162) = 01/02/1999

Additionally, we should recall the TimeSerial() function and CDate(), its use on TimeSerial() values as well. For more information, as of this writing, Microsoft's KB has the article &quot;HOWTO: Get Date or Serial Result from DateSerial or DateValue&quot; (Q95510) at:
