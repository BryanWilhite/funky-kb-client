OPERATORS: =
The basic assignment operator is the equal sign, which assigns the value (literal or variable) on its right to the variable on its left:

Code:
x = a;

The assignment operator can also be combined with a variety of other operators to provide shorthand versions of standard operations. It combines with the arithmetic operators +, -, *, / and % to give the following shorthand versions:

a += b instead of a = a + b
a -= b instead of a = a - b
a *= b instead of a = a * b
a /= b instead of a = a / b
a %= b instead of a = a % b

It also combines with the following bitwise operators:

a &lt;&lt;= b instead of a = a &lt;&lt; b
a &gt;&gt;= b instead of a = a &gt;&gt; b
a &gt;&gt;&gt;= b instead of a = a &gt;&gt;&gt; b
a &= b instead of a = a & b
a ^= b instead of a = a ^ b
a |= b instead of a = a | b
