Invoking ./vmware-install.pl may cause this error: “The path &quot;/usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.24-24/include&quot; is a kernel header file 
directory, but it does not contain the file &quot;linux/version.h&quot; as expected.  
This can happen if the kernel has never been built, or if you have invoked the 
&quot;make mrproper&quot; command in your kernel directory.  In any case, you may want to rebuild your kernel.” Not that 2.6.24-24 is likely to change over time.

Instead of rebuilding your kernel, install a linux-headers-* package with:

    sudo apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`

This should add new files in your /usr/src folder—a bunch of folders with symlinks pointing to another image of source files for your running kernel.
