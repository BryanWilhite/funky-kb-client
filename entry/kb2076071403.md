Projecting data out of SQL Server 2000 with SELECT statements is not that difficult once one appreciates the &quot;Universal Table.&quot; Things become hairy and beta-like when we deal with INSERT and UPDATE procedures using XML. I do not like what I see. Here is what I have read so far:

&quot;OPENXML&quot;
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/psdk/sql/ts_oa-oz_5c89.htm

&quot;Using OPENXML&quot;
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/psdk/sql/ac_openxml_1cx8.htm

&quot;PRB: Limitations of OpenXML in SQL Server 2000&quot;
http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q279/4/34.ASP

In the XML for SQL Server 2000 Web Release 2, Beta 1 read &quot;Using Updategrams to Modify Data.&quot;

I expect Microsoft to come out with an XML Server of some kind. Perhaps that is what BizTalk Server is?
