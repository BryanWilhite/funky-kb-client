Flash 4 introduced loadVariables() and loadVariablesNum(). I assumed that an earlier version of Flash developed one of the functions to deprecate the other but this assumption is wrong.

While not running in &quot;expert mode,&quot; Flash promises to automatically switch from loadVariables() to loadVariablesNum() when an integer is entered for the level parameter. For the experts out there this implies that:

    loadVariables(&quot;assets/copy.txt&quot;, _root) = loadVariablesNum(&quot;assets/copy.txt&quot;, 0);

I really can't technically explain why there are two functions introduced in the same version of Flash doing the same thing. There must be political/historical account beyond my scope.
