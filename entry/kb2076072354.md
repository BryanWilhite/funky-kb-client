SQL specifies two different syntactical ways to express joins. The first, called &quot;explicit join notation&quot;, uses the keyword JOIN, whereas the second uses the &quot;implicit join notation&quot;. The implicit join notation lists the tables for joining in the FROM clause of a SELECT statement, using commas to separate them. Thus, it specifies a cross-join, and the WHERE clause may apply additional filter-predicates. Those filter-predicates function comparably to join-predicates in the explicit notation.
