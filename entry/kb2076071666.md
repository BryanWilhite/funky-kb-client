The System event log can show this W32Time error: &quot;The time provider NtpClient is configured to acquire time from one or more time sources, however none of the sources are currently accessible.&quot; In the &quot;good old&quot; days of the innocent Internet you could run this command and call it day:

    net time /setsntp:tock.usno.navy.mil

However, times have changed (pun not really inended) and the USNO NTP Network Time Servers Web page (http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/ntp.html) clearly states that access to these time servers limited. Lowly servers like mine are excluded.

This is understandable and recoverable. According to ntp.isc.org there are &quot;open access&quot; time servers available for us &quot;end-users.&quot; For details see:

    http://ntp.isc.org/bin/view/Servers/NTPPoolServers

After all these years, it follows that our net time command is now:

    net time /setsntp:pool.ntp.org

One point of entry for more details about this matter with regard to Windows Server 2003, is MSKB article 816042 &quot;How to configure an authoritative time server in Windows Server 2003&quot; at:
