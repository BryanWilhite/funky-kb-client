Just remember the following:

* An event must be of a delegate type

* A delegate may require custom event arguments of a programmer-defined type

So we see three things to consider when building events: (i) the declaration of the event; (ii) the declaration of the delegate on which the event depends; (iii) the definition of any event arguments specified in the delegate declaration.
