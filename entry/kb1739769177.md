Using constructor functions to create user-defined objects is the &quot;old&quot; but respectable---and backward-compatible way of getting the job done. Building the constructor function is the first step in creating the user-defined object. This creation has the form:

    function myConstruct(arg1, arg2, arg3) {
  
        //Properties:
        this.property1 = arg1
        this.property2 = arg2
        this.property3 = arg3

        //Methods:
        this.method1 = myFunc1
        this.method2 = myFunc2
        this.method3 = myFunc3
    }

The instantiation is the second and final step; it has the form:

    objUser = new myConstruct

such that objUser.property2 will return the value of arg2 immediately after the instantiation.

The &quot;new&quot; way to create user-defined objects is via what Netscape calls &quot;object initializers&quot; for their 4.0-class browsers (JavaScript 1.2). This creation has the form:

    objectName = {property1:value1, property2:value2,..., propertyN:valueN}
