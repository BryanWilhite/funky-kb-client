If you have ever developed on SharePoint, there's gotta be at least once when you came across the superbly detailed error message:

“Unknown error” …and its likes.

That's when we have to start ploughing through the humungous amount of log entries in &quot;%programfiles%&bsol;&bsol;Common Files&bsol;&bsol;Microsoft Shared&bsol;&bsol;Web Server Extensions&bsol;&bsol;12&bsol;&bsol;Logs&quot;. Well, but there’s an easier way—the log files doesn’t have to be humungous!

We can throttle the log file outputs, depending on which area of SharePoint that we are working on. From the SharePoint Central Administration, navigate to Operations and Diagnostic Logging.
