Phosphorus is a mineral that's necessary for the formation of bones 
and teeth. It also makes up part of DNA and RNA. Phosphorus is important to the body because it regulates energy metabolism in cells, helps absorb glucose, and plays a major role in the acid-base balance in the body. 

You can find phosphorus in almost all foods, particularly in protein-rich foods like milk, meat, fish, eggs, poultry, and nuts. Other good sources of phosphorus include baked goods, processed eats, cheeses, and soft drinks. 

The recommended daily allowance of phosphorus is 700 milligrams per day for adults 19 to 70 years old, and 1,250 milligrams per day for children nine to 18 and for women who are pregnant or breast-eeding. The phosphorus level found in normal diets is not harmful. However, excess consumption of phosphorus can reduce the levels of calcium in the blood, resulting in bone loss.
