To make the most seamless boolean union possible, the objects should be aligned and of equal longitude such that vertices &quot;touch.&quot; In the simple case of an aligned sphere and cylinder of the same longitude, the vertical lines of the cylinder will appear tangential to the sphere longitude lines when the are both placed at the origin via the Primitives panel. Using snap to grid helps facilitate alignment.
