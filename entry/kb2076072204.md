It specifies that an iterator has come to an end. You can think of yield break as return statement which does not return value.

For example, if you define a function as iterator, a body of the function may look like this:

for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
    yield return i;
}

Console.Out.WriteLine(&quot;You will see me&quot;);

Note that after the loop has completed all cycles, the last line gets executed and you will see the message in your console app.

Or like this with yield break:

int i = 0;
while (true) {
    if (i &lt; 5) {
        yield return i;
    } else {
        // note that i++ will not be executed after this
        yield break;
    }
    i++;
}

Console.Out.WriteLine(&quot;Won't see me&quot;);

In this case last statement is never executed because we left function early.
