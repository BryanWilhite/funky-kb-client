Please see MSDN article &quot;Creating a Custom Spell-Checker with Word 2003 and Visual Basic .NET&quot; last seen here:

Pros:

* You don't have to pay more for a third-party spelling package.

* You don't have to wait for a user-friendly, Windows Forms version of an open source spelling package to get its ASP-centric act together.

* You can use leverage the investment made in custom dictionaries of MS Word.

* Nothing extra to install on machines running MS Office.


Cons:

* Loading an instance of MS-Word takes several seconds and upwards of 30MB of memory by default. It is best to open Word on a separate thread.

* You can't be sure which version of Office this stuff works on: either Office XP or Office System 2003. You have carry around PIMs (Primary Interop Assemblies) for both.
