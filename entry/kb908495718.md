ADO Objects are not found in a hierarchy; they logically lie side by side. For example, the Command, Connection and Recordset objects can open a connection to a database. It is up to the programmer to decide the &quot;best&quot; way to open the connection.

There is no FindFirst method inside the Recordset object. There is only the Find method. Moreover there is no NoMatch property: when an ADO Recordset cannot find a row it moves to EOF (making EOF = True). WARNING: when specifying criteria strings in a Find, use single quotes only.

It appears that ADO cannot see DAO objects. It follows that you cannot treat a DAO query like a stored procedure. I beleive I am confined to using MS-SQL strings.

The AbsolutePosition property in DAO is zero-based; in ADO it is one-based.
