The edit work item dialog is not functional due to a Multithreaded Apartment/Single-threaded Apartment issue. Powershell runs in MTA mode and the TFS work item editor control requires STA mode. Currently there doesn't seem to be any nice way of launching a STA thread from Powershell.
- The move work item iteration functionality seems to update the local work item instance, but the change doesn't flush to the server.
- I haven't been able to successfully load the TFS assemblies from within Powershell on a 64bit install of Windows.
