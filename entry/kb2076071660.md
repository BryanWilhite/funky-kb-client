This script is inspired by two MS KB articles:

&quot;PRB: 'Troubleshooting Orphaned Users' Topic in Books Online is Incomplete&quot;

    http://support.microsoft.com/kb/274188

and

&quot;HOW TO: Resolve Permission Issues When You Move a Database Between Servers That Are Running SQL Server&quot;

    http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240872

These articles remind us that there is difference between a &quot;login&quot; (defined at the server level) and a &quot;user&quot; (defined at the database level). The login name and the user name are often the same and this can lull us into the assumption that that a login and a user are the same.

A login and a user are linked by a server-specific, security identifier (SID). When a database is moved to a new server (or removed and restored to the same server) this link can be undefined (or broken). This script attempts to define/repair this link.
