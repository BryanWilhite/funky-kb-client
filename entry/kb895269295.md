Use the Show method to open VB forms. This is quite different from the robust functionality available in Access' OpenForm method of the DoCmd object. There is only one optional parameter in the Show method, Owner.

Note: Using the Show or Hide method on a form is the same as setting the form's Visible property in code to True or False, respectively.

To close a form, use the Unload method of the VB object. The form is:

    VB.Unload &lt;object name&gt;

in most cases a form's Exit button would have a Click event like the following:

    Private Sub cmdExit_Click()
        VB.Unload Me
    End Sub
