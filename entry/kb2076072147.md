To access the cached data or the application manifest in a document, you must first create a ServerDocument object by passing the document to one of the ServerDocument constructors. You can then access the cached data by using the CachedData property, and you can access the application manifest by using the AppManifest property. The application manifest provides information about the customization assemblies that are attached to the document. For more information, see Application and Deployment Manifests in Office Solutions.
