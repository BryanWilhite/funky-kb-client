The Option Constructor has been with us since Netscape 2.0. It provides JavaScript to dynamically build OPTION tags for SELECT tags. As of this writing, Doc JavaScript goes into detail at:

    http://webreference.com/js/tips/000118.html

However, I question that using history.go(0) is necessary to display OPTION tags created on the fly.

Ancient Netscape text regarding Option Constructors might still be unearthed at:
