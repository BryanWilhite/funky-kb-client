When a network of computers exchanges information with another network via a communications protocol called TCP/IP, we have what can be called Internetworking---the productive activity on the Internet.

TCP/IP or Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol is the abstract &quot;middle layer&quot; that supports specialized protocols designed for different needs. These specialized protocols include Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), News Network Transfer Protocol (NNTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

The HTTP layer is known popularly as the World Wide Web.
