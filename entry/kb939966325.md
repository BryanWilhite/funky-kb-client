Eating plenty of broccoli, or simply doubling your intake of fruits and vegetables from five servings a day to ten, can increase the antioxidant power of your bloodstream by about 13 to 25 percent, according to a recent study. 

The study, which was conducted by researchers at the U.S. Department of Agriculture/Agricultural Research Service Center on Aging at Tufts University, examined the effect of fruits and vegetables ranking high in an antioxidant assay called ORAC. Although the role of antioxidants in health and disease prevention is not yet well defined, these active compounds are thought to reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and cataracts. 

The following fruits and vegetables rank highest in ORAC antioxidant power: 

Prunes 
Raisins 
Blueberries 
Blackberries 
Strawberries 
Raspberries 
Plums 
Oranges 
Red grapes 
Cherries 
Kale 
Spinach 
Brussels sprouts 
Alfalfa sprouts 
Broccoli florets 
Beets 
Red bell peppers 
Onions 
Corn 
Eggplant
