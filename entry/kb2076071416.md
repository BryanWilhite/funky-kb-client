The MS-SQL wildcard character '*' cannot be used in dynamic SQL statements scripted in ASP running against ADO. ADO must deal with ODBC or SQL Server conventions and requires '%' as the wildcard character.

The problem is associated with the error message: &quot;Expression cannot be used with the LIKE predicate in query expression.&quot; For more details see MS KB article Q162977:
