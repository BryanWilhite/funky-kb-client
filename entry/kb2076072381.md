The South was the real source of Egypt’s wealth as it had been for Egypt’s civilization. The South actually had all Egypt at its mercy. The gold mines were there and it was where the vast stone quarrying, copper, and tin mining were conducted. From the South came most of the papyrus plants from which the Blacks invented paper and built the first and finest boats from the same tough leaves. The South had all the ivory and, at that time, was the only source of the highly-prized ostrich feathers, etc. In short, Egyptian foreign trade depended almost entirely on Southern Ethiopia.
