Okay, so I can't afford near-field monitors. I have two sets of Labtecs. I have the LCS-1030 which has a range from 50Hz to 18kHz and I have the LCS-2414, from 40Hz to 20kHz.

Note that the 1030 has &quot;Dynamic Bass Equalization - Actively adjusts bass equalization for distortion-free sound at all listening levels&quot; which &quot;sounds like&quot; these &quot;studio reference&quot; speakers would be misleading. The 2414 gives no-nonsense low-budget bass.
