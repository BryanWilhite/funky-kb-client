Without much fanfare here it is: I depend on the Windows NT operating system to handle security features in my ASP solutions. I have no trouble creating a single point failure: the operating system itself. When something goes wrong in terms of security both Microsoft and myself can share the blame!

The IIS user IUSR_&lt;Machine Name&gt; and the NTFS file system are the starting points in the quest for tight ASP security. Fore more details we have:

    http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q142/8/68.ASP

When ASP pages connect to a SQL database, I avoid storing passwords in the ASP files by depending on ADO to connect via NT security. This implies that IUSR_&lt;Machine Name&gt; has the ability to connect to SQL server. This idea is based on reading the following:

    Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 Security
    http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/techart/sql7security.htm

    HOWTO: Connect to the Microsoft SQL Server Through the Use of Named Pipes

If I run into any problems while implementing security features, I should refer the following:
