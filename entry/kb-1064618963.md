I found out the hard way that AMD K6-2 processors do not work with Windows 95 (the OEM version of Windows 95 has a fix from Microsoft). This is not the fault of the hardware. For more information please see Microsoft Knowledge Base article Q192841 (&quot;Problems Using High Speed AMD K6-2/350 Central Processing Unit&quot;).

I was forced to upgrade to Windows 98.
