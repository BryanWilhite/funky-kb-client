The pre-compiled version(s) of VMware Tools does not work with Ubuntu running a kernel newer than 2.6.15-27-386. Note that this problem persists in VMware Workstation 5.5.4.

The quick and dirty solution to this problem is use GRUB to select the &quot;old&quot; kernel. This process is shown in the &quot;Menu Configuration&quot; section of &quot;Boot with GRUB&quot; by Wayne Marshall here:

The other option involves compiling your own version of VMware Tools.
