“There are two options to change a hard drive from FAT32 to NTFS. You can use the Convert.exe command from a DOS prompt in Windows or you can delete the existing FAT32 partition or volume and create a new NTFS partition in Disk Management.”

“Western Digital recommends deleting the existing FAT32 partition and creating a new NTFS partition. Using the Convert.exe command may cause data corruption or loss.”
