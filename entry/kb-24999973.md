Netscape and Microsoft Internet Explorer 2.x do not support HTTP downloads. This probably applies to AOL 2.x for both Mac and PC. The symptoms of this is when a URL pointing to a binary file in an HTTP serviced directory jumps to a new page and starts loading ASCII garbage instead of proceeding to a file transfer dialog.
