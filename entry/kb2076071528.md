Microsoft readily reminds us that &quot;correlated subqueries&quot; can be included in the WHERE clause:

    SELECT au_lname, au_fname
    FROM authors
    WHERE 100 IN
       (SELECT royaltyper
       FROM titleauthor
       WHERE titleauthor.au_ID = authors.au_id)

This form is discussed in detail here:

    http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/acdata/ac_8_qd_11_67lc.asp

But what is not mentioned is that these sub-queries are supported in the SELECT projection list like the following:

    SELECT DISTINCT
        title_id
    ,   au1 = (
            SELECT
                au_id
            FROM
                titleauthor
            WHERE
                au_ord = 1
            AND
                title_id = t.title_id
        )
    FROM
        titleauthor AS t

It is an error to use a sub-query that returns more than one row of data. This form is discussed in detaail in &quot;The Practical SQL Handbook&quot; (a link to the book should be listed on this page at songhaysystem.com).
