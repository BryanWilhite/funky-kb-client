To remove projects from your Most Recently Used list (and from the VS.NET Start Page) remove keys or edit values under the following key:

    HKEY_CURRENT_USER&bsol;&bsol;Software&bsol;&bsol;Microsoft&bsol;&bsol;VisualStudio&bsol;&bsol;7.0&bsol;&bsol;ProjectMRUList

Yes, Visual Studio .NET uses the Windows Registry extensively. I assumed that all user settings would be in XML files but I was wrong. At present, it's back to the future.
