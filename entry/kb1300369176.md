Travelers who fail to take precautions while visiting developing countries can catch more than an eyeful of scenery. 

To get the most out of your visit without the &quot;bug&quot; getting the better of you:

* Drink bottled water only. Avoid tap water and ice. 

* Order from menus. Avoid buying from street vendors or eating from buffets, which might have been sitting out for several hours under unsanitary conditions. 

* Avoid salads and undercooked or raw seafood and meat. 

* Eat only peeled fruits and vegetables.
