The :first-line pseudo-element
The :first-line pseudo-element applies special styles to the contents of the first formatted line of a paragraph.

The :first-letter pseudo-element
The :first-letter pseudo-element must select the first letter of the first line of a block, if it is not preceded by any other content (such as images or inline tables) on its line. The :first-letter pseudo-element may be used for &quot;initial caps&quot; and &quot;drop caps&quot;, which are common typographical effects.

The :before and :after pseudo-elements
The ':before' and ':after' pseudo-elements can be used to insert generated content before or after an element's content.
