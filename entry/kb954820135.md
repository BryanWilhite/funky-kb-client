The majority of vegetable oils contain mostly monounsaturated and 
polyunsaturated fats. When used in place of saturated fats, these oils can lower your (bad) blood cholesterol levels. Oils that contain monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are corn, soybean, olive, canola, and sunflower oils. 

Remember that when some vegetable oils are hardened to become 
margarine or shortening, they're more likely to contain &quot;trans fat.&quot; To avoid these oils, check out the labels and look for margarines that contain liquid vegetable oil as the first ingredient (the first ingredient listed is the product's chief ingredient).
